It has removed a lot of the power from the big banks, who have weaponized their platforms against the American people, and I could not be more proud to be here,” he said.

The company reported second-quarter revenue of $4.28 million, down from $4.39 million in the prior-year period.

Operating cash flow remained negative at $2.27 million for the six-month period, though this improved from the $3.02 million cash burn in the prior year.New Jersey ExpansionRecently, the Virginia Beach-based company announced plans to acquire its first New Jersey location, which would add approximately $2 million in annual revenue and expand its network to 15 hospitals across 10 states.“This proposed addition of our first New Jersey location would mark an important milestone in our growth strategy,” said CEO Kimball Carr in a company statement released August 7.

However, the company's performance exceeded its own guidance.Property sales led to decline in rental income and FFO IRental income fell by 21.7 per cent to EUR 27.8 million (H1 2024: EUR 35.5 million) due to property sales. Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell to EUR -24.9 million in the same period (H1 2024: EUR -14.1 million). The decline is mainly related to write-downs on loans granted to Limes companies (Impairment of financial and other receivables: EUR -12.5 million).FFO I after taxes and before minority interests and interests on shareholder loans amount to EUR 5.0 million (H1 2024: EUR 15.5 million).Further property sales and increasing letting performanceThe market value of the DEMIRE portfolio declined to around EUR 747.3 million (31 December 2024: EUR 779.3 million). Both the sales of the properties in Bad Kreuznach, Dortmund and Trier and the value adjustments in the sales portfolio led to a decline in the portfolio value. As a result, the net asset value (NAV, undiluted) decreased by EUR 0.48 to EUR 1.97 per share in the reporting period (31 December 2024: EUR 2.45). Ralf Bongers, CIO of DEMIRE, says: ""Property sales are developing positively. We have already generated EUR 40 million in proceeds in the current year. We expect further success with the planned property sales in the second half of the year.""Letting performance expanded to 40,460 m² (H1 2024: 25,000 m²). The EPRA vacancy rate rose slightly to 17.3 per cent (31 December 2024: 15.1 per cent). The average remaining lease term (WALT) of the entire portfolio increased to 4.8 years following the conclusion of lease agreements (31 December 2024: 4.6 years).Declining net debt ratio foreseeable; further partial repayment of the bond achievedThe average nominal cost of debt remained virtually unchanged at 4.31 percent per annum in the reporting period. The net debt ratio (net LTV) was 42.4 percent, slightly above the year-end figure for 2024 (40.9 percent). Cash and cash equivalents decreased to EUR 34.9 million as of the reporting date (31 December 2024: EUR 44.8 million). ""The sales currently being implemented will generate additional liquidity and contribute to a further reduction in debt. In addition, in July 2025, we were able to use proceeds from new property financing to partially repay the corporate bond. The outstanding nominal now amounts to EUR 247.1 million,"" explains Tim Brückner, CFO of DEMIRE.Guidance for 2025 raisedFrank Nickel, CEO of DEMIRE, says: ""DEMIRE successfully completed transactions and new financing in the first half of 2025 and made initial progress in further reducing the bond. At the same time, we recorded operational improvements, particularly in the area of leasing. In view of the earnings development in the first half of the year and the current assessment for the rest of the year, we see scope to adjust our forecast for the full year 2025 upwards.""The Executive Board is therefore raising its guidance for the 2025 financial year. In this respect, rental income is expected to be between EUR 52.0 and 54.0 million EUR and FFO I (after taxes, before minority interests and interests on shareholder loans) between EUR 5.0 and 7.0 million EUR.End of press releaseInvitation to the conference call on 14 August 2025Trending Investment OpportunitiesAdvertisementArrivedBuy shares of homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100.

The company's particular strength lies in realising real estate potential in these locations and focuses on an offering that is attractive to both international and regional tenants. As of 30 June 2025, DEMIRE had a real estate portfolio of 48 properties with a lettable area of around 582 thousand square metres. Taking into account the proportionately acquired Cielo property in Frankfurt/Main, the market value amounts to around EUR 1.0 billion.The portfolio's focus on office properties with an admixture of retail and hotel properties is appropriate for the risk/return structure of the commercial property segment. The Company attaches great importance to long-term contracts with solvent tenants and the realisation of potential and therefore continues to expect stable and sustainable rental income and solid value growth. DEMIRE's portfolio is to be significantly expanded in the medium term. In expanding the portfolio, DEMIRE will focus on FFO-strong assets with potential, while properties that do not conform to the strategy will continue to be sold in a targeted manner. DEMIRE will continue to develop its operations and processes with numerous measures. In addition to cost discipline, operating performance is being improved through an active asset and portfolio management approach.The shares of DEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AG DE are listed in the Prime Standard of the German Stock Exchange in Frankfurt.Contact: Julius StinauerHead of Investor Relations & Corporate FinanceT: +49 6103 372 49 44E: ir@demire.agLoading...Loading...Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Operating cash flow remained negative at $2.27 million for the six-month period, though this improved from the $3.02 million cash burn in the prior year.New Jersey ExpansionRecently, the Virginia Beach-based company announced plans to acquire its first New Jersey location, which would add approximately $2 million in annual revenue and expand its network to 15 hospitals across 10 states.“This proposed addition of our first New Jersey location would mark an important milestone in our growth strategy,” said CEO Kimball Carr in a company statement released August 7.

The call, hosted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, featured former Attorney General Eric Holder, chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York was also on the call.A source familiar with the call said Holder provided ""a high-level overview to the House Democratic Caucus on the latest in the fight against Donald Trump's gerrymandering scheme in Texas and across the country."" Texas has become ground zero in the redistricting battle after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott called a special session of the state Legislature last month to consider a new congressional map that would net a five-seat Republican majority. The Texas Senate passed the map Tuesday in a 19-2 vote, with many Democratic lawmakers walking out in protest. Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans a quorum in their chamber, but Abbott has vowed to call another special session if they do not return before the Legislature adjourns at the end of the week. ""This is an effort to stifle Americans who have had enough,"" Texas House Democratic Caucus Chairman Gene Wu said in a press conference Wednesday. ""Republicans know that their agenda and what they have done is so unpopular with not just liberals or Democrats but with all Americans that they need to cheat to rig the system so they can stay in power."" California has vowed to redraw its congressional map in retaliation if Texas ultimately approves the new districts. The state's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, wrote to President Trump this week urging him to call off Texas and other red states from taking further action. Newsoms office announced a press conference Thursday touting a ""major announcement.""    ""DEMOCRATS WILL DESTROY GREG ABBOTT'S 'TOTALLY RIGGED MAPS.' TREMENDOUS WORK IS BEING DONE,"" the California governor's office posted on X, imitating Mr. Trump's social media style.  ""DONALD TRUMP…. GET READY FOR THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PAYBACK YOU'VE EVER SEEN!!! "" The NDRC's nonprofit arm, the National Redistricting Foundation, was involved in a lawsuit against Texas over its current maps. The organization has also made calls and held briefings with state and local leaders and partners.  Former President Barack Obama is slated to headline a fundraiser for NDRC with Holder and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi next week. Holder served as attorney general during the Obama administration. ""In this moment, steps must be taken to respond to the authoritarian measures being considered in certain states and now so brazenly taken in Texas,"" Holder said in a statement. ""We must preserve our democracy now in order to ultimately heal it.""

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Tesla’s in-car visualizations for features like Autopilot and Full Self-Driving might be getting an upgrade with a switch to Epic Games’ Unreal Engine. As reported by Not a Tesla App, Tesla hacker greentheonly says they found evidence of the change in Tesla’s 2025.20 firmware for Tesla Model S and Model X cars with AMD chips.Unreal Engine is perhaps best known as a development tool for video games, but Epic has been making a bigger push as of late for automakers to use Unreal Engine. Currently, Tesla uses the Godot engine for the visualizations, according to greentheonly, so if Tesla switches to Unreal Engine, it would join a growing number of automakers that use Epic’s engine inside its cars, including Rivian, Ford, GMC, Volvo, and Lotus.Tesla and Epic Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. This isn’t the first time the two companies have been connected to each other; Tesla’s Cybertruck was added to Fortnite last year.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersElectric CarsCloseElectric CarsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Electric CarsEntertainmentCloseEntertainmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EntertainmentGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPC GamingClosePC GamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PC GamingTeslaCloseTeslaPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TeslaTransportationCloseTransportationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TransportationMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 56.21 in the Financial Services industry, PagSeguro Digital Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 7.1. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.

To fund the repayment, we plan to draw on the approximately $300 million in cash we expect to receive from the reversion and settlement of our U.S. pension fund (the Kodak Retirement Income Plan, or “KRIP”) in December. However, the KRIP reversion is not solely within Kodak’s control and therefore is not deemed “probable” under U.S. GAAP accounting rules, which is what triggered the “going concern.” Once the KRIP reversion is completed Kodak will be virtually net debt free and will have a stronger balance sheet than we have had in years.”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealGoogle posts an official look at the Pixel 10 Pro FoldThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Microplastics are turning up all over the place, including in the air we breathe.That’s why health and environmental advocates, as well as a coalition of governments, are pushing for an ambitious plastics treaty in Geneva. Recycling isn’t enough — only limiting production can stem the tide of plastic pollution, they contend.Recycling isn’t enough“That you can find microplastics in urban air, that’s not really shocking because it’s been reported before in other cities. I think this is just a way of illustrating that nowhere is free from this pollution,” says David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories.Greenpeace strapped an air-monitoring device to a person while they went about their day in Geneva, spending about eight hours in and out of shops, cafes, office spaces, and a railway station. The samples they collected on July 17th were meant to show what a typical visitor to the city might be exposed to; they weren’t able to take any samples within the negotiation rooms that delegates would actually use.The device had a replaceable silver filter that Greenpeace researchers were then able to analyze to see what particles they caught, which amounted to at least 165 fibers and fragments. The filters picked up a range of different materials like bits of skin, plant-based fibers, and what was likely soot. Greenpeace was interested in synthetic materials, however, and was ultimately able to identify 12 pieces of microplastics, including polyester, nylon, polyethylene used to make bottles and bags, and other types of plastics. That might not sound like much, but the organization only had the equipment to be able to detect larger particles that were at least 10 microns in size. (For comparison, the average human hair is about 70 microns in diameter.)“If they found the big ones, it’s a pretty fair bet that the smaller ones were there, as well,” says Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health and the Common Good Program at Boston College, who was not involved in the Greenpeace study.Generally, the smaller the particle, the more problems it can potentially pose by being able to penetrate deeper into organs and tissues in the human body. A human brain might contain as much as a spoon’s worth of microplastics, research published in the journal Nature Medicine earlier this year suggests.“Unfortunately, microplastics are pretty much everywhere in today’s world,” Landrigan says. He’s the lead author of an August report, published in the journal The Lancet, on the links between plastic pollution and health outcomes.“Plastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age,” the report says, adding that plastics are responsible for $1.5 trillion in health-related economic losses each year. The report accounts for all the risks along the lifecycle of plastic, including chemicals that workers and communities near manufacturing facilities are exposed to, and waste that breaks down into nanoplastic particles that have been found in human bodies and breastmilk.“Plastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age”Scientists are still working to understand the health impacts of inhaling microplastics in the air. Landrigan points out that we at least know that all plastics are made of two main components, a carbon-based backbone derived from fossil fuels and chemical additives.“When the microplastic comes into the human body, whether you inhale it or drink it with your water or eat it with your food, when it it gets into you and the plastics move from your gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, the microplastic particles are carrying all those chemicals with them,” Landrigan says.The more than 16,000 different chemicals used in plastics production — including the carcinogen vinyl chloride, for example — are primarily responsible for the known health risks associated with plastics. But the toxicity of more than 75 percent of the chemicals in plastics have yet to be studied.Greenpeace doesn’t claim to be assessing air quality in Geneva or the health impacts of what they found in their air samples. All they can show is the presence of microplastics in the air, adding to previous research that has done the same. What’s notable now is that Greenpeace has documented this at a time when leaders from around the world have the opportunity to actually do something about it.Negotiations on a plastics treaty in Geneva are scheduled to end on August 14th. In 2022, United Nations member states agreed to develop a legally binding pact on plastic pollution. It’s been an uphill battle to agree on terms ever since. Major fossil fuel producing nations blocked a deal in December, pushing negotiations past their initial 2024 deadline. So far this year, there’s still a fight over whether focusing on recycling and reducing plastic waste is enough. The fossil fuel industry and countries including the US that produce a lot of plastics and its ingredients are fighting efforts to exclude limits to plastic production from the treaty.A “high ambition coalition” launched by Rwanda and Norway, on the other hand, wants to address the full lifecycle of plastic, starting with production. It’s also open to using the treaty to phase out or restrict the use of problematic chemicals in plastics.RelatedWhy California is suing ExxonMobil for ‘perpetuating the lie’ of plastic recyclingIt doesn’t make sense to simply mop up the mess plastic leaves behind without also turning off the faucet, says Angel Pago, Greenpeace global plastics campaign media lead. “We’re brimming with plastic because of overproduction. And we cannot solve this crisis with just, you know, cleanups,” Pago tells The Verge from Geneva.The Lancet article similarly says “the principal driver of this [health] crisis is accelerating growth in plastic production.” Production has ballooned from 2 metric megatons in 1950 to 475 in 2022. Less than 10 percent of plastic waste has ever been recycled, in part because the many chemicals used to manufacture different types plastics make it difficult or uneconomical to rehash the material.“If we’re going to do something about plastics, we need to cap plastic production,” Landrigan says. “I hope and I pray that the treaty negotiators are actually going to produce a treaty that protects human health.”Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Justine CalmaCloseJustine CalmaSenior Science ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Justine CalmaClimateCloseClimatePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ClimateEnvironmentCloseEnvironmentPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All EnvironmentHealthCloseHealthPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HealthPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyReportCloseReportPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ReportScienceCloseSciencePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ScienceMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The device shows the name Kindle Petit Color in the corner of one image, although the post author says that name hasn’t been finalized yet.The Redditor says the screen’s colors are “much better than the Colorsoft” and the prototype lets you adjust the intensity and saturation of individual colors. The size of the device’s screen bezels are similar to Amazon’s entry-level black-and-white Kindle, but they claim it will actually be a little smaller than the 11th-generation version of the e-reader.According to the post’s author, the prototype’s user interface takes better advantage of its color E Ink screen, letting you change the colors of the battery, Wi-Fi, and shopping cart icons, as well as the reading progress status bar. The text of an ebook can also be colored and will dynamically transition from one color to another through four different shades as you progress through a book, giving you another visual clue as to when you’re near the end.These images and details are unconfirmed, and while Amazon has been expanding its lineup of color-screen Kindles, you should take this leak with more than a few grains of salt.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiAmazonCloseAmazonPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AmazonGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealGoogle posts an official look at the Pixel 10 Pro FoldThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 28.15 in the Capital Markets industry, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 16.37. Shareholders might be inclined to think that  the stock might perform worse than it's industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.Apple is developing a bunch of products and features to deliver its vision of AI, including multiple robots, a smart home display, and a revamped version of Siri with new technology powering it, according to an extensive report from Bloomberg. The company’s generative AI efforts lag those from other big tech companies, and it delayed some upgrades to Siri earlier this year, but these rumored new initiatives point to the smart home as a key place for its AI technologyOne of the robots is apparently a tabletop robot that “resembles” an iPad mounted to an arm that can move around and follow users as they move around a room, Bloomberg says. Apple has already shared a preview of what this could look like: earlier this year, the company published research showing a tabletop robot that looks like a real-life version of the Pixar logo with a lamp on the end of the arm. In videos, it’s quite charming — it can even dance.Video: AppleA key part of the device, which Apple is aiming to launch in 2027, would be a more visual version of Siri that users could have more natural conversations with, like what’s possible with ChatGPT’s voice mode. Bloomberg says Apple has tested using an animated take on the Finder logo for Siri, but the company is also apparently thinking about ideas that are more like Memoji. Apple is also revamping Siri so that it’s powered by LLMs.Apple is working on other robots, too, including an Amazon Astro-like robot that has wheels, and it has “loosely discussed” humanoid robots, according to Bloomberg.By the “middle of next year,” Apple plans to launch a smart home display that will let you do things like control your smart home, play music, take notes, and do video calls, Bloomberg says, and this device could have the new look for Siri. The display and the tabletop robot may have a new OS that can be used by multiple people, and could be able to personalize what’s shown to a user by scanning their face with a front-facing camera. Bloomberg says the smart home screen resembles a Google Nest Hub but has a square display.In addition to the smart home display, Apple is also working on a security camera, and it plans to develop “multiple types of cameras and home-security products as part of an entirely new hardware and software lineup,” Bloomberg says.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Jay PetersCloseJay PetersNews EditorPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Jay PetersAppleCloseApplePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AppleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsSmart HomeCloseSmart HomePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Smart HomeTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson and Gregory Katsas concluded that the plaintiffs did not have a valid legal basis for the court to hear their claims. The ruling was not on the merits of whether the government unconstitutionally infringed on Congress' spending powers.""The parties also dispute the scope of the district court's remedy but we need not resolve it ... because the grantees have failed to satisfy the requirements for a preliminary injunction in any event,"" Henderson wrote. Judge Florence Pan, who dissented, said the Supreme Court has held ""in no uncertain terms"" that the president does not have the authority to disobey laws for policy reasons.""Yet that is what the majority enables today,"" Pan wrote. ""The majority opinion thus misconstrues the separation-of-powers claim brought by the grantees, misapplies precedent, and allows Executive Branch officials to evade judicial review of constitutionally impermissible actions.""   The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for USAID to spend on global health programs and more than $6 billion for HIV and AIDS programs. Mr. Trump has portrayed the foreign aid as wasteful spending that does not align with his foreign policy goals.Henderson was nominated to the court by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Katsas was nominated by Trump. Pan was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden.

It is the world's largest bauxite miner and alumina refiner by production volume, and the eighth-largest aluminum producer. Profits are closely tied to prevailing commodity prices along the aluminum supply chain.Alcoa was the first mass producer of aluminum, launching the world-changing Hall-Heroult smelting process in the 1880s, making aluminum affordable. It listed as a public company in 1925. In 2016, Alcoa spun off its automotive and aerospace metal parts segment to focus on mining, smelting, and refining. It bought the 40% unowned balance of AWAC in mid-2024, meaning refining assets are now predominantly wholly owned, as with smelting.Alcoa's Current Market Status With a volume of 2,603,466, the price of AA is up 0.57% at $31.56.  RSI indicators hint that the underlying stock may be approaching overbought. Next earnings are expected to be released in 63 days.

A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 44.84 in the Trading Companies & Distributors industry, Fastenal Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 46.81. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Fastenal Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued. In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes.

The rating cites the firm's solid growth story, best-in-class new unit returns, significant whitespace, latent pricing power, and category-leading position as supporting a premium valuation.The company indicated that SSS trends exiting the second quarter and into the start of the third were running ahead of the 2.1% posted in the second quarter.Management also highlighted the firm's strong profitability during the period, with restaurant margins of 26.3% surpassing consensus expectations and G&A expenses coming in lower than anticipated.Supported by this solid expense control and operational efficiency, Carril writes that the company was able to reaffirm its full-year EBITDA guidance range of $152 million to $159 million.The analyst's 2025 and 2026 EBITDA forecasts are $154.6 million (+22% year over year) and $194.4 million (+26% year over year), respectively, versus consensus estimates of $159.5 million and $203.5 million.StifelAnalyst Chris O'Cull said that while same-store-sales growth of 2.1% missed Stifel's 5.5% and the Street's 6.3% forecasts, it doesn't justify a $2 billion market value drop.The analyst noted CAVA still beat EBITDA estimates, with new stores ramping ahead of schedule, creating a ""honeymoon effect"" that moderates comp impact but remains positive.He attributed second-quarter softness mainly to lapping last year's steak launch, with quarter-to-date trends improving, and said CAVA's growing scale and untapped marketing could drive comps.O'Cull views the weakness as temporary, not a shift in the company's fundamentals.Assuming the 2025 class declines 5%, the 2024 class is flat, and all other comp stores rise 5% in 2026, the analyst estimates an average SRS headwind of about 150 bps.TD CowenAnalyst Andrew M. Charles reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, lowering the price forecast from $120 to $90.Charles said the new store's sales strength shows the concept's growing portability. Despite softer sales, they are keeping the 2025–26 estimated adjusted EBITDA intact.However, he cautioned that shares may remain under pressure until the new store sales maturation path is clearer.The analyst stated that while the concept faces some risk from Gen Z's economic headwinds, they were encouraged by comments that trends improved in the second quarter and in July. This indicates that the third quarter is tracking at about 3% same-store sales ahead of the September 8 chicken shawarma launch and other initiatives to boost traffic.Price Action: CAVA shares are trading lower by 16.54% to $70.52 at last check Wednesday.Read Next: CAVA Operating In ‘Fluid' Macro Environment Creating' Fog For Consumers,' Says CFO — But No Pullback Yet Photo by Nicole Glass Photography via ShutterstockLoading...Loading...CAVACava Group Inc$71.07-15.9%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum15.36GrowthN/AQualityN/AValue12.81Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Whether it's a cozy vintage area rug or a wall-to-wall installation, carpets can make a house feel like a home, but they have one big drawback: they're notoriously difficult to keep clean. While we recommend professional cleaning every few years to keep your carpets in the best shape, the best portable carpet cleaners are an affordable way to tackle spills, stains, and everyday wear and tear.The best spot cleaners go far beyond just carpets; they're great for treating upholstery, furniture, and even your car. However, these portable devices are not meant for cleaning whole carpets — you'd be on your hands and knees for too long. For that, you'd want the larger, vacuum-sized machines we recommend in our guide to the best carpet cleaners.To find the best portable carpet cleaners — handheld machines that weigh under 15 pounds and are primarily used for spot-cleaning or tricky spots like carpeted stairs — we did extensive testing on targeted stains, tasked them cleaning an Airbnb, and consulted with professional cleaners. The Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro is our top pick for its superior suction, large water tank, and useful tools that isolate specific messes for easy cleaning. If you're looking for clean carpets for less, check out the Dirt Devil Portable Spot Cleaner, which is super lightweight and packs a punch with pet stains.Find out more about how Business Insider Reviews tests and reviews home products.Our top picks for the best portable carpet cleanersBest overall: Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro - See at AmazonBest budget: Dirt Devil Portable Spot Cleaner - See at AmazonBest compact: Bissell Little Green - See at AmazonBest for pets: Bissell Little Green HydroSteam - See at AmazonBest for spot cleaning: Hoover CleanSlate Plus - See at AmazonBest overall                                   Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro                                                    The Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro Portable Carpet Cleaner is a portable option for tackling heavy-duty stains, pet urine, and tricky spots. Plus, it's cleaning professional-approved.

Spray nozzle can become loose     Specifics  Model:2458 Weight:13.25 pounds Water tank:96 ounces Cord length:20 feet Extras:Stain trapper tool, 3-inch tough stain tool, and Pet Pro Oxy cleaner    The Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro is my dream cleaning machine. The sleek purple and black carpet cleaner stood out as soon as it arrived at my front door. I got it up and humming (quite loudly) within a few minutes, thanks to its simple setup and easy-to-understand instructions. In my testing, I found it removed stains caused by coffee and wine with minimal scrubbing thanks to its cleaner head being only around 3 inches wide, making it better for targeting specific stains, especially on furniture. The SpotClean Pet Pro performed the best out of the bunch at getting out red wine stains, which were barely noticeable after cleaning.Sara San Angelo, founder of Confessions of a Cleaning Lady and a cleaning professional with more than 20 years of experience, attributes good suction power, like that of a vacuum, to a carpet cleaner's performance — and Bissell is her favorite brand for these features. I personally found this to be true in my testing, where the Bissell showed strong suction that worked wonders on tough carpet stains like makeup and crayons.                              In this photo, you can see the Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro actively suctioning up melted chocolate from our testing carpet sample.                                                                    Shannon Ullman/Business Insider                                  The Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro Portable Carpet Cleaner is designed for most stains but focuses on pet stains and odors. As the host of a pet-friendly Airbnb, I needed this aspect of the carpet cleaner to work, and I was impressed when it lifted pet stains and odors that I'd spent far too much time removing with spot cleaning and my vacuum cleaner. The included stain trapper tool isolated the urine stain in its own tank, so I didn't have to worry about it contaminating the main tank. I will say that pet hair does tend to clog, but not as badly as other portable carpet cleaners I've tried. The large 96-ounce tank allows me to focus on the dirty corners for longer without constantly switching out the water. When it does need a change, it has a straightforward folding mechanism to open it up. It's also compact and easily fits in my storage cupboard.While it's lighter than traditional bulkier carpet cleaners, it's still one of the heavier portable carpet cleaners in our roundup. Despite the weight, I could maneuver it around the crevices in my car with relative ease during testing thanks to the extendable nozzle (which has stayed intact for me, though some reviews online say it is prone to deteriorating). While some reviews highlight a leaky water tank, I haven't had this issue, and it could be due to the tank not being appropriately secured before use. Bissell offers a two-year warranty, but you need to stick to using Bissell's cleaning solution, or you could void it.Best budget                                   Dirt Devil Portable Spot Cleaner                                                    The Dirt Devil Portable Spot Cleaner Machine is a budget-friendly and lightweight option for cleaning up occasional messes, light stains, and car upholstery.

Less expensive    What we don’t like    con icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.  Small dirty water tank with flimsy lid   con icon Two crossed lines that form an 'X'.  Smaller motor than competition means less suction     Specifics  Model:FD13000 Weight:8 pounds Water tank:19 ounces Cord length:15 feet Extras:2-in-1 pet tool, trial-size cleaning solution    For a powerful machine that costs under $100, we recommend the Dirt Devil Portable Spot Cleaner. The cleaning head is slightly wider than the Bissell, at 4.5 inches. However, it's still small enough to concentrate the solution in one spot, allowing for relatively easy removal of food stains like chocolate and wine. It didn't get the entire amount out, however, leaving the test carpet a light pink in spots.                              The Dirt Devil wasn't able to lift away all of the wine stain, and left a light pink residue on the carpet sample.                                                                    Shannon Ullman/Business Insider                                  The Dirt Devil has a nice look; however, the plastic feels cheaper than other carpet cleaners I tested, and it's likely the machine would show wear and tear over time. For example, the thin plastic water tank felt more susceptible to cracking if dropped, and the fold-out handle seems like it may lose some functionality over time. Despite looking a little more flimsy, it still performed well during testing on both new and set-in stains.It's also one of the lightest carpet cleaners I tested, but this comes at a cost, as the clean water tank capacity is only 19 ounces — much smaller than other models we tested. This meant plenty of refills during testing, so this model wouldn't be ideal for cleaning large spaces. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of picking up the dirty water tank by the lid during this test, and it popped open, spilling the tank's contents on the floor I had just cleaned. There is a warning on the lid, but it's easy to forget when emptying it multiple times during a big clean. I did like the self-cleaning hose, however, which meant I didn't have to remove various parts to clean them individually — a time saver.Best compact                                   Bissell Little Green                                                    Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. So, the portable Bissell Little Green cleaner is a great option for small spaces like apartments, tiny houses, and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or potentially even under your sink.

No stain trapper tool included     Specifics  Model:1400B Weight:9.65 pounds Water tank:48 ounces Cord length:15 feet Extras:3"" tough stain tool, Little Green formula with Oxy, and a HydroRinse self-cleaning hose tool    The Bissell Little Green Multi-Purpose Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner is our best compact carpet cleaner choice. This funky and lightweight model in the recognizable green (you may have seen it on TikTok) has the same 3-inch cleaner head as our best overall pick to help focus all of its energy on small, set-in stains. It truly was tough on stains, performing above average on wine, marker stains, coffee, and makeup. While it might not be the best choice for larger surface areas due to its smaller size and capacity, the overall cleaning was still super effective.The Little Green is an excellent choice for smaller spaces like apartments or cars — especially if there are no pets in the house — and it weighs a lot less than more heavy-duty carpet cleaners. At under 10 pounds, it was effortless to move it around while cleaning the stairs and in the bathroom during testing. Like other Bissell carpet cleaners I tested, it gobbled up oil stains and didn't take long to remove marker stains, which were not visible at all after cleaning.                              Despite its small size and light weight, the Little Green has a 48-ounce tank capacity so you don't have to refill often during cleaning.                                                                    Shannon Ullman/Business Insider                                  If you need a tougher tool that specializes in pet stains, paying the extra money for our best overall, The Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro, might be worth it. The SpotClean Pet Pro has double the tank capacity of the Little Green, and the stain trapper tool made it more effective, particularly on pet stains. While the Little Green advertises itself as effective for pets, I noticed pet hair became trapped inside the tough stain tool and required soaking in hot water to remove it.The warranty is also half the time of its bigger brother. However, I still love this nimble carpet cleaner for the price. It has a big enough capacity to tackle areas like my car without emptying and refilling too often. I also love the HydroRinse self-cleaning hose tool to keep the machine clean between uses.Best for pets                                   Bissell Little Green HydroSteam                                                    The Bissell Little Green HydroSteam is a powerhouse for households with pets: it tackles hair without clogging and has a steam cleaning option for treating pet stains without chemicals.

Expensive     Specifics  Model:3618 Weight:13 pounds Water tank:64 ounces Cord length:15 feet Extras:5-inch tough stain tool, multi-surface tool, and cleaning formula    The Bissell Little Green HydroSteam Multi-Purpose Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner is Bissell's most premium carpet cleaner and a great option for pets. I put its credentials to the test on particularly furry parts of my Airbnb and areas that were, unfortunately for me, soiled by pets who came to stay.What I love most about this carpet cleaner is its three different modes: SteamWash, Steam, and Wash. The steam-only setting, in particular, is unique among competitors and allows the machine to be used on hard surfaces like tile in the bathroom to make them sparkle and shine. The SteamWash setting is ideal for pet stains since it sanitizes and loosens tough stains better than models that only use suction. The heated cleaning also means the machine has a super quick drying time of around 25 minutes on fabric surfaces, which I appreciated when I had to get the Airbnb ready for a guest's imminent arrival on one occasion.                              As the name suggests, the Little Green HydroSteam has the option to add steam to your carpet cleaning, which means you can easily treat tough stains with fewer chemicals.                                                                    Shannon Ullman/Business Insider                                  Thanks to the steam cleaning, this carpet cleaner performed above average in removing red wine stains, coffee stains, and makeup stains and average in removing chocolate and marker ink. The Little Green HydroSteam also easily handled fur and human hair and, unlike the base Bissell Little Green, didn't clog.I also love that this carpet cleaner's steam feature meant I didn't have to rely as heavily on harsh chemicals as other options. The cleaner head is slightly larger than the other Bissell carpet cleaners to tackle larger stains with less elbow grease, and the hose is a stretchy 5 feet in length to reach hard-to-get spots.The capacity of the clean tank is 64 ounces, which is in between the other two Bissell options I tested. The cords and cleaning hose wrap nicely around the machine when not in use. It weighs 13 pounds, which is light enough to move between rooms or out to the car. It also has the longest warranty of any Bissell in our roundup (3 years) and has an excellent design that suits its premium price tag.Best for spot cleaning                                   Hoover CleanSlate Plus Carpet & Upholstery Spot Cleaner                                                    The Hoover CleanSlate Plus is great for reaching tough-to-access spots thanks to the tight spot tool, which complements the 4.5-foot hose to get into tricky places.

Priming the pump can be time-consuming if suction isn’t working     Specifics  Model:FH14000 Weight:9.4 pounds Water tank:40 ounces Cord length:15 feet Extras:7-inch wide path tool, tight spot tool, hose rinse tool, and trial-sized solution    The Hoover CleanSlate Plus is an excellent companion for spot cleaning. I liked how I could switch the 7-inch wide path tool (the largest cleaner head in our roundup) to the much smaller tight spot tool when I needed to focus on a smaller area. This attachment was handy during the car cleaning test as I could reach down the sides of the seats where I noticed some grime and used the more direct sprayer and the smaller brush head to get it up.Back inside, I put it to work on the usual pet stains left by guests in my Airbnb, which it handled efficiently. It did a great job removing makeup stains from the shaggy carpet in the bedroom and quickly took care of coffee grounds on the living room carpet. In our standardized cleaning tests, the Hoover performed below average with chocolate stains and average when it came to removing red wine stains, but excellent with coffee and makeup.                              The Hoover CleanSlate Plus was very effective at removing coffee grounds from our carpet testing samples.                                                                    Shannon Ullman/Business Insider                                  This sturdy and clean-looking device runs relatively quietly compared to other spot cleaners, making cleaning for longer periods less annoying. It's also lightweight, at under 10 pounds, and was easy to move around the house as I went from stain to stain. The clean water tank capacity is on the smaller side, at 40 ounces, which means more refilling than some of the other options.I also noticed how compact the whole device was after wrapping the hose neatly around the machine afterward. The main drawback I found was that you need to prime pump the first time you add cleaning solution, which is an extra step I didn't have to do with other cleaners. It also only has a 90-day warranty.What to look for in a portable carpet cleanerWith the help of Sara San Angelo, founder of Confessions of a Cleaning Lady with more than 20 years of cleaning experience, we nailed down the most important aspects of a great portable carpet cleaner.Suction power: San Angelo said suction strength is the most important factor to consider. ""Just like suction strength in a vacuum, this will matter most in how clean the carpets get,"" she said. ""It is useless if you have a great carpet cleaner that can't get up the solution it sprays on the carpet.""Most models don't advertise suction strength, but wattage can be a good indicator. Higher wattage means more power to facilitate better suction.Attachments: The best portable carpet cleaners I tested have easy-to-use attachments that focus all the machine's power on small but stubborn stains. Additionally, my favorite models had built-in attachments to clean the water hose, making maintenance easier.San Angelo said pet owners should pay particular attention to what specialized brushes and attachments come with each machine and look for tools specifically designed to handle pet hair. No matter how much pre-vacuuming you do, there will still be hair in your carpets if you have pets, and it can get clogged in your carpet cleaner. ""Hair can bog down the machine, and it is important to have one that can handle that type of debris,"" said San Angelo.Weight and size: If you plan on cleaning many different areas in your house, it's important to find a portable carpet cleaner that is lightweight and compact. A machine that weighs under 10 pounds will be easy to move from stain to stain, and will typically be more compact for storage.Cord and hose length: It's a fact of life that some stains are not located directly next to a wall socket. Carpet cleaners with longer power cords and hoses can reach the whole staircase in one go and out to external areas like the car without too much hassle. Most of the units we tested had 15-foot cords, with the Bissell SpotClean Pet Pro being the only design with a 20-foot long cord. Cordless designs are also becoming more widely available, but then you have to consider battery life, too, which typically ranges from 15 to 35 minutes. We'll be testing cordless options in our next round of testing.Water tank size: Once you start cleaning carpet stains, it might be difficult to stop; I've found this out firsthand at my Airbnb. We preferred carpet cleaners with water tanks of 48 ounces or more, which was usually enough to tackle most of the stains in our testing environment without refilling.How we test carpet cleaners                              We tested each carpet cleaner in real-life conditions and standardized testing, like lifting new and set-in stains off of carpet samples.                                                                    Shannon Ullman/Business Insider                                  These portable carpet cleaners went through tons of testing. I used carpet samples to spot-test a variety of common stains, such as red wine, chocolate, marker ink, and coffee. I also tested each portable cleaner in my Airbnb after guests, especially those who brought dogs. I made sure to pay attention to little details like how often I had to replace the solution, fix a clog, or adjust a setting.Food and drink stains: Arguably the most common carpet stain. I tested each carpet cleaner on new and historic coffee, oil, sauce, and chocolate stains applied to carpet samples.Makeup and marker stains: Makeup stains are common on the bedroom carpet and can be tricky to clean. I used powder and cream makeup to create stains on carpet samples and evaluated how well each model cleaned them up.Pet hair and waste: I used the carpet cleaners in my Airbnb after guests stayed with pets, and I also used them at home in my cat's most heavily trafficked areas and around her litter tray.Car cleaning: For this test, I noted how easy each carpet cleaner was to use in hard-to-reach areas, like beside the seats, and how maneuverable they were. The best carpet cleaners for the car test also had large water tanks, so I didn't need to go back inside to refill and empty them.Attachments: All carpet cleaners have different attachments to enhance the cleaning experience. I noted how easy it was to switch between attachments and how well they worked while in use.Carpet cleaner FAQsHow can I deep clean my carpet myself?Carpet cleaners are the best way to remove visible stains and get beneath the obvious stains on top to remove dust, dirt, and allergens hidden underneath.However, if you don't have a carpet cleaner, San Angelo recommended the following steps for cleaning up carpet stains:Clean up the excess with a rag, aiming to blot instead of rub.Spray cleaning solution on the affected area and again blot instead of rubbing side to side to avoid spreading the stain.What is the best thing to clean a carpet with?A carpet cleaner is the best tool for cleaning carpets. These machines clean carpets thoroughly thanks to specialized attachments that deliver cleaning solution and the suction it up to lift away stains. A portable carpet cleaner is a great option for spot cleaning and awkward spots like stairs, but if you're cleaning a large area, we recommend a full-size carpet cleaner.What is the most effective carpet cleaning method?If you are planning on cleaning a whole carpet, not just spots, the best method is professional steam cleaning. However, if you're looking to spot clean or maintain carpets between professional cleanings, a portable carpet cleaner is a solid option to have on hand.

  Rigetti Computing, Inc. RGTI shares are trading higher on Wednesday.The firm released its second-quarter results after Tuesday’s closing bell, with quarterly losses of 13 cents per share, which missed the analyst consensus estimate for losses of 6 cents. Quarterly revenue came in at $1.8 million, which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $1.88 million and is down from revenue of $3.086 million from the same period last year.Also Read: Rigetti Vs.

Quinn Bolton reiterated the Buy rating on the stock, with a price forecast of $18.Bolton said Rigetti met its mid-year goal with a four-chiplet, 36-qubit Cepheus-1-36Q QPU reaching 99.5% median two-qubit fidelity. He added that this strengthens management’s confidence in delivering a >100-qubit system with 99.5% median two-gate fidelity by year-end. He also noted quantum advantage remains about four years away and will require meeting four key specifications.Rigetti, which went public in February 2022 as the second pure-play quantum firm, is a full-stack pioneer with proprietary quantum-classical infrastructure and is well-positioned to benefit as the industry advances in the near and long term.Bolton added that its approach, built on scalable multi-chip processors designed, manufactured and housed at Fab-1, lets commercial and government customers explore applications while the company and peers work toward fully fault-tolerant systems.According to the analyst, existing partnerships and customer ties should lead to follow-on R&D agreements and larger opportunities as scaling continues.Analysts expect that from 2026 onward, the company will raise its qubit count to the hundreds and improve median two-qubit gate fidelity to 99.9%. They also anticipate the introduction of qLDPC-based quantum error correction.Benchmark: Roadmap to 1,000 QubitsAnalyst David Williams reiterated the Buy rating, raising the price forecast to $20 from $14.Williams said Rigetti remains on track to deliver a 100-qubit, multi-chiplet QPU with 99.5% two-qubit gate fidelity by year-end, a key step toward quantum advantage. He noted the newly released Cepheus-1 met that fidelity goal while cutting error rates, debuting what he views as the industry’s largest multi-chip processor for quantum computing and reinforcing the scalability of Rigetti’s architecture.He added that these gains firm up the roadmap to a 1,000+-qubit system with 99.9% fidelity, built-in error correction, and sub-50 ns gate times needed for advantage.While management still sees a three-to-four-year timeline to reach that threshold, the analyst expects meaningful revenue opportunities well before then.Williams also highlighted that Rigetti increased cash by $350 million to about $570 million during the period, which he believes is sufficient to fund continued investment through commercialization.Management said the long-term objective over the next three to four years is a 1,000-qubit system targeting 99.9% fidelity, built-in error correction, and sub-50 ns gates, enabled by advances in cabling, cryogenics, and chiplet density.They also argued the chiplet architecture is the only practical route to scale and noted strong patent protection.Price Action: RGTI shares are trading higher by 1.31% to $16.41 at last check Wednesday.Loading...Loading...Read Next: Warren Buffett’s Big Bets: 10 Of Berkshire’s Largest Deals Reveal Diversification Strategy Image via ShutterstockRGTIRigetti Computing Inc$16.391.18%Stock Score Locked: Edge Members OnlyBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.Unlock RankingsEdge RankingsMomentum99.73GrowthN/AQualityN/AValue2.02Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Over the past month, BorgWarner Inc. BWA stock increased by 17.24%, and in the past year, by 26.72%.

A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 24.09 in the Automobile Components industry, BorgWarner Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 37.87. Shareholders might be inclined to think that BorgWarner Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.

Windows Insiders can now test a new update to the Xbox app that lets them install games locally, instead of having to rely on Xbox Cloud Gaming.Currently, the Xbox app on devices like the Qualcomm-powered Surface Pro 12 will only let you play cloud games from Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service. This new Xbox update will mean some ARM64 games from PC Game Pass or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will be available on Qualcomm-powered devices for the first time.Microsoft says its Windows and Xbox teams are working together on this Xbox app effort to ensure it has compatibility across the Game Pass catalog, and it’s also “developing new features that will enable more games to be played on Arm-based Windows 11 PCs in the coming months.”Microsoft originally released an ARM64 version of its Xbox app in 2022, but there weren’t enough games natively compiled for Windows on Arm.

The most notable update, thanks to product shots shared by reliable leaker Roland Quandt, is a new square design for the camera, which has previously been pill-shaped. It will also supposedly be called the Insta360 Go Ultra, instead of the Insta360 Go 4 had the company stuck with its previous naming convention.According to the leaks, the Insta 360 Go Ultra measures a little over an inch on each side (30mm) with the lens located in the corner of the camera. It weighs 53 grams, which is quite a bit heavier than the 35.5 gram Go 3 and 26.5 gram Go 2, but the Go Ultra features a new 1/1.28-inch sensor and 4K/60fps video capabilities. That’s twice the framerate of the updated Go 3S that was introduced about a year ago.The camera will feature stabilization and a horizon lock feature, as well as an Active HDR mode that can capture more vivid videos when recording at 4K/30fps. The Go Ultra will also include a redesigned Action Pod dock that includes a flip-up screen for live previews and doubles as a wireless remote. It will also boost the Go Ultra’s runtime, but specific details about the new camera’s battery life aren’t known yet.As for a potential release date? Previous iterations of the Insta 360 Go have debuted in June and even earlier, but leaks haven’t yet revealed when the company plans to officially launch the latest version.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiCamerasCloseCamerasPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All CamerasGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing the banks behind Zelle over claims that their payment platform enabled “massive amounts of fraud” that caused customers to lose more than $1 billion between 2017 and 2023. In the lawsuit, James alleges Zelle was rushed to market, resulting in a design that made the platform “an obvious conduit for fraudulent activity.”Early Warning Services (EWS), a company owned by major institutions including Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others, launched Zelle in 2017 as a way to let customers send money from their bank account to other users on the platform. However, James claims EWS “knew from the beginning that key features of the Zelle network made it uniquely susceptible to fraud” and still “failed to adopt basic safeguards.”One of the alleged issues highlighted by James’ lawsuit includes a registration process that ”lacked important verification steps” that enabled scammers to sign up using misleading email addresses, which they could use to pose as a government employee or business to trick Zelle customers into sending them money that they couldn’t get back. Following government pressure, Zelle began paying back victims of imposter scams in 2023.Additionally, James claims EWS did not ensure that banks reported customer complaints about fraud in a “timely” manner and falsely advertised the service as a “safe” money transfer tool. “Even when EWS did receive reports of fraud, it failed to promptly remove the fraudsters from the Zelle network or require banks to reimburse consumers for certain scams,” James alleges.RelatedChase will start blocking Zelle payments over social mediaZelle needs to fix ‘significant scams and fraud,’ lawmakers sayThe lawsuit touches on many of the same points as the one initially filed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In March, the CFPB dropped its lawsuit against Zelle amid the Trump administration’s attempt to dismantle the agency and the firing of former head Rohit Chopra, who had taken an aggressive approach to tech regulation. That still hasn’t stopped scrutiny from federal lawmakers — and now, New York’s attorney general.Zelle spokesperson Eric Blankenbaker pushed back on these claims in a statement to The Verge, saying Zelle “leads the fight to stop fraud and scams” in the US. “This lawsuit is a political stunt to generate press, not progress,” Blankenbaker says. “The Attorney General wants to hand criminals a blueprint for guaranteed payouts with no consequences, opening the floodgates to more scams, not less. That’s bad policy and puts consumers at greater risk.”Attorney General James claims EWS violated New York law and is asking for restitution and damages for all New Yorkers harmed by scams on Zelle. “I look forward to getting justice for the New Yorkers who suffered because of Zelle’s security failures,” James said in the press release.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsPolicyClosePolicyPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PolicyPoliticsClosePoliticsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All PoliticsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Over the past month, Fidelity National Finl Inc. FNF stock increased by 13.47%, and in the past year, by 7.14%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders are optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Trending Investment OpportunitiesAdvertisementArrivedBuy shares of homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100.

A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 15.18 in the Insurance industry, Fidelity National Finl Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 15.26. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Fidelity National Finl Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued. In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes.

Corporate bankruptcies this summer have surged to their highest levels since 2020. The list for July filings includes names such as Del Monte Foods and LifeScan Global.    Some beloved 1990s and 2000s brands were among the companies to file for bankruptcy this summer, continuing a troubling trend that hints at pain beneath the surface of the US economy.      Forever 21 and Joann's are among the companies that filed for bankruptcy recently, with many famous retailers closing stores and reducing their physical footprint. Data from S&P 500 Global shows that this summer, US corporate bankruptcy filings surged to their highest level since 2020, with 71 public and private companies filing for bankruptcy last month. That's an increase from June, when 63 companies filed for bankruptcy.     Despite a strong stock market and 3% economic growth in the second quarter, some once-prominent names reported hard times in July, citing difficult economic conditions. ""Companies are contending with elevated interest rates as uncertainty from US tariff policy pressures costs and supply chain resilience,"" S&P 500 Global said.Canned goods producer Del Monte Foods, for example, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, noting declining demand and high inventory costs. Leadership also cited a heavy debt burden. Del Monte had combined debts of between $1 billion and $10 billion, Business Insider reported last month.     While the August numbers have not been reported yet, a few prominent companies have already filed for bankruptcy, including fashion retailer Claire's. The retailer submitted its second Chapter 11 filing on August 6, also citing declining demand and high interest rates.That puts it in the same category as Forever 21, Rite Aid, and Party City, all once-popular retail chains that have filed for bankruptcy and closed locations in 2025.

Get in before Q3 trades take off →Amid a flurry of bullish developments for Ethereum ETH/USD, its sibling chain, Ethereum Classic ETC/USD, has seen a significant price surge, rising 30% in the past month. Here’s what investors need to know.This rally coincides with major institutional interest in ETH, including daily ETF inflows surpassing $1 billion and a rumored $20 billion corporate purchase by Bitmine, fueling speculation of a spillover effect.Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum blockchain. In 2016, following a major hack, the Ethereum community controversially decided to perform a hard fork to reverse the fraudulent transactions, creating the chain now known as ETH.A contingent of users who believed in the immutability of the blockchain, that “code is law”, rejected this change and continued to operate on the original, unaltered ledger, which was preserved as Ethereum Classic.Get StartedTrade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and More Instantly — No Wallets, No HassleSpeculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500. Get StartedDisclosure: 82% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyHistorically, ETC’s price action is closely correlated with that of ETH. Positive news and strong upward momentum for Ethereum often trigger a “sympathy play” into Ethereum Classic. Investors, particularly those looking for a lower-priced entry point to capitalize on the broader Ethereum ecosystem’s hype, often turn to ETC. As analysts from firms like Standard Chartered set price targets for ETH as high as $7,500, the massive capital inflows and heightened market sentiment for ETH are creating a powerful tailwind for ETC, driving its value higher as traders anticipate it will follow its larger counterpart’s trajectory.Read Also:  Bitcoin Cracks $120,000, Ethereum Taps $4,700 As Solana Surges Past $200 Loading...Loading...$ETCEthereum Classic - United States dollar$24.041.61%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum79.50Price TrendShortMediumLongOverview$ETHEthereum - United States dollar$4688.342.14%This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Verra Mobility has a better P/E ratio of 96.28 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 21.58 of the Professional Services industry. Ideally, one might believe that Verra Mobility Inc. might perform better in the future than it's industry group, but it's probable that the stock is overvalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.

HawkinsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew J. Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.A new company is launching today that claims to have developed “the first volume-produced, consumer-ready autonomous vehicle — designed from the ground up for private ownership at scale.” The company is called Tensor, and it describes itself as a “leading AI agentic company” that’s based in San Jose, California — but little information exists online about who or what may be behind this new effort.But according to a trademark application filed last April, Tensor is affiliated with AutoX, an autonomous vehicle developer with operations in the US as well as China.In its announcement, Tensor makes no mention of AutoX or China. The company says it’s “dedicated to building agentic products that empower individual consumers” and that the Tensor robocar is its flagship product. It also claims to have offices in Barcelona, Singapore, and Dubai. It’s likely that AutoX spunoff its US-based team as Tensor to get around government restrictions on Chinese software in vehicles. A spokesperson for the company did not respond to questions about its affiliation with AutoX.According to a trademark application filed last April, Tensor is affiliated with AutoX, a Chinese autonomous vehicle developer with operations in the US as well as its home country.AutoX has been testing its vehicles in and around San Jose since 2016. It’s not as well-known as some of the other autonomous vehicle startups in the US and China. The company was founded in 2016 by former Princeton professor Jianxiong Xiao, a specialist in 3D learning, computer vision, and robotics (who also apparently goes by “Professor X,” according to LinkedIn). Since then, AutoX has nabbed several high-profile investors, including China’s Dongfeng Motor Group and e-commerce giant Alibaba.In 2020, it partnered with Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) to launch a robotaxi service in China. In 2022, it opened a robotaxi operation center in San Francisco with the goal of launching a commercial service — though it has yet to obtain the appropriate permits to do so. For the permits it does have, the company appears to have filed its rebranded name with the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Tensor is one of only six companies, along with Waymo and Zoox, with a permit to test fully driverless vehicles on public roads in California.Now it appears to be pivoting from robotaxis to “robocars.” Tensor says its vehicle is “the first and only L4 autonomous vehicle available for personal ownership.” It says it will launch in the US, Europe, and the Middle East starting in 2026.“When the world shifts… how will you move?” said Amy Luca, chief marketing officer at Tensor, in a press release. “We are building a world where individuals own their personal AGI agents, enhancing freedom, privacy and autonomy. With Tensor, we’re introducing the world’s first personal Robocar, ushering in the era of AI defined vehicles. This isn’t a car as we know it. It’s an embodied personal agent that moves you.” (Luca is the former executive vice president and head of social at Monks, a marketing firm based in London, according to her LinkedIn.)“When the world shifts… how will you move?”In using buzz words associated with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, Tensor appears to be trying to insert itself into the hype-strewn world of chatbots and artificial general intelligence. After all, autonomous vehicles are so last decade.Tensor’s robocar appears to be no slouch, either. It comes with an array of high-tech sensors, including “37 cameras, 5 lidars, 11 radars, 22 microphones, 10 ultrasonic sensors, 3 IMUs, GNSS, 16 collision detectors, 8 water-level detectors, 4 tire-pressure sensors, 1 smoke detector, and triple-channel 5G.” Of course, those sensors won’t be cheap, though Tensor did not put a price on its future robocar.Several companies have designs to sell privately owned autonomous vehicles, but none have achieved that milestone. Tesla CEO Elon Musk keeps promising that the “unsupervised” version of the company’s Full Self-Driving feature is just around the corner, but he has yet to deliver. GM has also said that it will eventually sell fully driverless cars to customers. But there remains a thicket of cost and liability concerns that will need to be ironed out before any company can take that next step.Update August 13th: After the publication of this article, Tensor spokesperson Lena Allen responded with a statement about the brand’s relationship to AutoX, and AutoX’s relationship to China:Since its founding in 2016 in San Jose, Auto X has been an American company. Its new consumer brand, Tensor, is also headquartered in San Jose, California, with satellite offices in Spain, the UAE, and Singapore. Tensor focuses on the US, EU, and the GCC markets. As an independent private California startup, they’re controlled by their U.S. employees, with significant majority investment/ownership from the UK, Japan, Korea and US. In 2018, Auto X launched their autonomous delivery service in San Jose for over 1000 self-driving delivery orders, operating until Covid lockdown. In 2020, Auto X received the second-ever driverless AV testing permit in California.In 2019, AutoX entered the China market as a foreign company in China. We managed to obtain local self-driving test permits alongside with other foreign companies, such as BMW, Tesla, and VW. During the pandemic lockdowns in the U.S., we launched a fully driverless robotaxi fleet in China. However, starting several years ago, AutoX began winding down its China operations; all operations under the AutoX brand in China have been divested, with all offices closed and operations shut down.

Over the past month, AppFolio Inc. APPF stock increased by 7.94%, and in the past year, by 20.00%. With performance like this, long-term shareholders are optimistic but others are more likely to look into the price-to-earnings ratio to see if the stock might be overvalued.Trending Investment OpportunitiesAdvertisementArrivedBuy shares of homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100.

It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. AppFolio has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 91.1 of the Software industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.

The current Price to Book ratio of 11.45, which is 0.83x the industry average, is substantially lower than the industry average, indicating potential undervaluation.   The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 14.02, surpassing the industry average by 1.96x, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.   The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 8.19%, which is 1.1% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.   The Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $44.43 Billion is 62.58x above the industry average, highlighting stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.   The company has higher gross profit of $52.43 Billion, which indicates 35.91x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.   The company's revenue growth of 18.1% exceeds the industry average of 15.45%, indicating strong sales performance and market outperformance.  Debt To Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company.Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.In light of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, a comparison between Microsoft and its top 4 peers reveals the following information:  In terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, Microsoft has a lower level of debt compared to its top 4 peers, indicating a stronger financial position.   This implies that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity with a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.18.  Key TakeawaysFor Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE and PB ratios suggest the company is undervalued compared to its peers, indicating potential for growth. However, the high PS ratio implies that the stock may be overvalued based on its revenue. In terms of profitability, Microsoft's high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit margins outperform its industry peers, reflecting strong financial performance. Additionally, the high revenue growth rate indicates a positive outlook for the company's future earnings potential.This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.MSFTMicrosoft Corp$530.460.23%Stock Score Locked: Edge Members OnlyBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.Unlock RankingsEdge RankingsMomentum82.19Growth97.02Quality68.85Value13.67Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

Image: CarreraAndrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew Liszewski is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.Carrera, a German company that has been making slot car toys since the ‘60s, has announced a new scaled racing experience that does away with the slots altogether. Carrera Hybrid still has you racing 1:50-scale cars around a reconfigurable track, but you control them using an app on a mobile device and you’re now free to steer anywhere you want, even off the track to overtake an opponent.Carrera Hybrid is already available internationally, but the company is launching a starter set in the US on September 1st for $199.99 that includes a mix of 15 straight and curved track pieces and a pair of Porsche 911 GT3 R racers. The company currently offers a wide selection of licensed vehicles for its traditional slot car products, but plans to expand the Hybrid version with recognizable cars from Mercedes-AMG, Audi, and BMW.Carrera Hybrid currently features Porsche 911 GT3 R vehicles, but the company plans to expand with other licensed cars. Image: CarreraInstead of drawing power from metal rails on the track, the Carrera Hybrid vehicles use rechargeable batteries good for about 30 minutes of racing. Each one connects to a mobile device like a smartphone or a tablet over Bluetooth. You can steer the vehicles by physically turning your device like a steering wheel, but the free accompanying mobile app, available for iOS and Android, can also be paired with a wireless controller making the racing feel more like a video game.The RC vehicles aren’t limited to the Carrera Hybrid tracks. They can be remotely driven anywhere, opening up new ways to overtake opponents. Image: CarreraSensors on the bottom of each car detect printed patterns on the track so the app always knows the position of all the vehicles, and while up to 30 users can race on a single layout, the app limits that to 16 for competitive races where stats are tracked. The free roaming nature of Carrera Hybrid creates more opportunities to overtake opponents while the app increases the realism through sound effects and by letting players fine tune the performance and handling of their vehicles including tire grip and brake sensitivity. The app can also simulate various track conditions for a bigger challenge, or assist less experienced racers with driving aids.The company says it spent the past few years developing the Carrera Hybrid. It’s reminiscent of Anki Drive that debuted in 2013 with a fixed track layout, and the follow-up, Anki Overdrive, that introduced reconfigurable track layouts in 2015. Overdrive offered a lot of the same features and functionality of Carrera Hybrid, plus AI-controlled opponents, but Anki eventually shut down in 2019. Hopefully, given Carrera has been making racing toys for around 60 years, it will continue to invest in its Hybrid offering and keep the AI-powered racing sets around for a lot longer than Anki did.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsToysCloseToysPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ToysTransportationCloseTransportationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TransportationMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.We’ve heard about upskilling and re-skilling due to AI — but how about de-skilling? A new study published this week found that doctors who frequently use AI to detect cancer in one medical procedure got significantly worse at doing so.The researchers set out to discover whether continuous exposure to AI impacted doctors’ behavior when conducting colonoscopy, so they decided to assess “how endoscopists who regularly used AI performed colonoscopy when AI was not in use.”The answer: Not so hot. The rate was about six percentage points lower.The study was published in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology journal by medical professionals and researchers in countries including Poland, Norway, Sweden, the U.K., and Japan. It followed doctors at four endoscopy centers in Poland, which were part of a trial program focusing on AI’s use in colonoscopy for potential cancer prevention.It raises questions about the use of AI in healthcare, when it helps and when it could hurt. Last week, The Verge reported on a Google healthcare AI model’s instance of potentially hallucinating a body part and where medical professionals think the industry will go from here.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Hayden FieldCloseHayden FieldSenior AI ReporterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Hayden FieldAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIHealthCloseHealthPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HealthNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsScienceCloseSciencePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All ScienceMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The chart shows in the early trade small cap stocks are moving even higher. The chart shows in spite of the large move yesterday, small caps are still in zone 2 (resistance). The chart shows small caps are still below the prior high marked by the upper band of zone 1(resistance) even though S&P 500 and Nasdaq have moved to new highs. Money is flowing aggressively in IWM for two reasons:  The belief is building that small caps will catch up. Small caps are interest rate sensitive.   A 50 bps interest rate cut fever has all of a sudden gripped the stock market after the release of CPI data.  Some momo gurus are even calling for a 100 bps cut.  The prevailing wisdom has shifted to the data no longer being important and President Trump will get what he wants from the Fed.  There is merit to this thinking as independent thinkers driven by data are rapidly vanishing.   On August 4, we wrote:  In our analysis, the probability of a rate cut in September is 70%.  The probability of a rate cut in September has now risen to 85%.  In our analysis, there are still some independent thinkers at the Fed who are not going to appease President Trump.   In our analysis, the amount of the rate cut in September will come down to the data between now and the Fed meeting.   In our analysis, the Producer Price Index (PPI) data that will be released tomorrow at 8:30 am ET has gained more importance.  The stock market's reaction to PPI will confirm if the latest prevailing momo crowd wisdom of ""data does not matter"" is transient or longer term. On the 50 bps rate cut fever, in addition to small caps and tech stocks, money is also flowing into interest rate sensitive sectors such as housing and banks.  The housing ETF of choice is iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB), and the banking ETF of choice is SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE).  As full disclosure, bank ETF KBE is in our portfolio.  Home builder KB Home (KBH) is also in our portfolio. Money Flowing Into ChinaAs China gains the upper hand over the U.S., foreign money is flowing into China.  Overnight, stocks in Hong Kong were up 2.6%.Magnificent Seven Money FlowsIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc (AAPL), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), and Tesla Inc (TSLA).In the early trade, money flows are neutral in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), and NVIDIA Corp (NVDA).In the early trade, money flows are positive in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).Momo Crowd And Smart Money In StocksTrending Investment OpportunitiesAdvertisementArrivedBuy shares of homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100.

Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.  The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.  If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.  A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.Traditional 60/40 PortfolioProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.  Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.Benzinga Disclaimer: This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

A lower P/E could indicate that shareholders do not expect the stock to perform better in the future or it could mean that the company is undervalued. BellRing Brands has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 28.17 of the Personal Products industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions.

  Ethereum's ETH/USD next moonshot might be brewing — and it's not coming from a meme coin army, but from Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc's BMNR boardroom. The Cathie Wood, Peter Thiel and Tom Lee backed crypto infrastructure company is reportedly planning to raise a staggering $20 billion for one purpose: to buy ETH. Track ETH price swings here. That's double the scale of the last big corporate buying spree, which sent prices from $2,000 to $4,500, noted an X user. And if history rhymes, this time the jump could be seismic — with $15,000 ETH whispered as ""programmed.""Read Also: Congressman Joins Cathie Wood, Peter Thiel In Tom Lee’s Bitmine Immersion Ethereum Treasury—Then Cashes OutGet StartedTrade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and More Instantly — No Wallets, No HassleSpeculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500. Get StartedDisclosure: 82% of retail CFD accounts lose moneyHistory Says Big Buys Move MarketsIn crypto's short but volatile history, corporate treasuries piling into ETH have tended to fuel price increases. The last time $10 billion worth of ETH was snapped up, the market nearly doubled in value within months. The reasoning is simple: when a player with deep pockets takes that much ETH off the open market, scarcity and FOMO do the rest.The $20B FactorDoubling the buying power changes the game. Bitmine's $20 billion plan could drain available liquidity far faster than retail investors or even most funds can react. That could mean aggressive upward price pressure — especially if the move sparks a broader institutional rush into Ethereum. But traders and investors should keep in mind that the same factors that can propel ETH toward $15,000 can also magnify volatility.Beyond The Price TargetWhile the $15,000 number makes headlines, the real significance may be in what this says about Ethereum's place in institutional strategy. If Bitmine pulls this off, it signals a new era where corporate balance sheets treat ETH not just as a speculative asset, but as a core holding — potentially alongside Bitcoin, real estate, and equities.Whether or not ETH rockets to $15,000, a $20 billion single-entity buy is an undeniable statement of conviction. In crypto, sentiment is as important as code — and Bitmine's blitz could be the bullish spark the market has been waiting for.Loading...Loading...Read Next:  The Shrinking Bitcoin Dominance Story No One’s Talking About Photo: Shutterstock$ETHEthereum - United States dollar$4716.602.76%Stock Score Locked: Want to See it?Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.Reveal Full ScoreEdge RankingsMomentum87.50Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewBMNRBitMine Immersion Technologies Inc$67.848.65%Market News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

The 116-inch Hisense 116UX is available now from “select national retailers and authorized resellers” including Best Buy for $29,999, while a newly announced 100-inch version called the 100UX is $10,000 cheaper at $19,999.Traditional Mini LED TVs feature backlighting that use an array of tiny white or blue LEDs that are frequently paired with a layer of quantum dots to finetune the color of the light illuminating the pixels on the TV’s LCD panel. It can improve a TV’s color reproduction and is a cheaper alternative to MicroLED display technology, but Hisense’s RGB-MiniLED technology further improves color accuracy and vividness through the use of individually controlled red, green, and blue LEDs in the backlight.Hisense claims its new TVs can reproduce 95 percent of the BT.2020 color space. Samsung says its new Micro RGB TV reproduces 100 percent, by comparison, but we don’t yet know how much its 115-inch model will cost when it eventually makes its US debut.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Andrew LiszewskiCloseAndrew LiszewskiSenior Reporter, NewsPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Andrew LiszewskiGadgetsCloseGadgetsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GadgetsNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTVsCloseTVsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TVsMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.Now that Pebble is Pebble again, we’re getting an official look at the new Pebble Time 2 that’ll ship to customers later this year. (We got a sneak peek back in March, but those were preliminary designs.)The designs were posted today by Core Devices CEO Eric Migicovsky on his blog and YouTube. The Time 2 will come in four colors, though they haven’t been finalized that yet — Migicovsky says the company is looking for input from Pebble fans. The device will feature stainless steel front, back, and buttons resembling those from the Pebble Time Steel. There’ll also be multicolor RGB backlighting, a second microphone, screw-mounted back cover, and a compass. It also weighs about 48 grams with the strap, and 32.5 grams for the case itself. This is in addition to the specs that were previously teased, like a 1.5-inch 64 color e-paper display, touch screen, standard 22mm straps, heart rate monitor, and 30-day battery life.“This is basically the watch of my dreams,” Migicovsky says in the video. So far, the design evokes the same minimalist feeling as the original Pebble Time, but with a sleeker profile and rounded edges. Compared to the slightly more dressed up Pebble Time Steel, the bezels on the new Pebble Time 2 are also significantly smaller. The glass is also flatter, so there’s less reflection when viewed from an angle.In his blog, Migicovsky notes that folks who want to switch orders from the Pebble 2 Duo don’t have to do anything special. There’ll be a survey sent out to those who have pre-ordered in the next month or so.

The rise was attributed to better business conditions and an increased belief in the potential for business expansion.Despite the positive outlook, there is still a significant level of uncertainty, as indicated by an 8-point spike in the uncertainty index, which now stands at 97. Labor quality emerged as a primary concern, with 21% of small businesses identifying it as their most pressing issue, a 5-point increase from June.When asked about the future, 16% of respondents expressed a desire to expand their businesses, marking a 5-point increase from the previous month. The NFIB’s chief economist, Bill Dunkelberg, noted that while optimism has increased, uncertainty remains high. He expressed hope that the next six months will bring more clarity, especially regarding the permanent 20% Small Business Deduction and the final form of trade policy.SEE ALSO: Trump Administration Releases $5 Billion EV Charger Funds After Legal Battle, Simplifies Review Process For StatesAI Can Help Small Businesses Navigate Tariffs, InflationThe rise in optimism comes despite concerns over tariffs and inflation.

He endorsed targeted tariffs for strategic industries while criticizing across-the-board trade measures.As the uncertainty around tariffs exist, Shark Tank star, Kevin O’ Leary, says his 50-odd small businesses are using AI to combat inflation, lower operational cost and tackle margin pressure.Furthermore, a potential shift in Wall Street’s focus towards the small-cap space has been observed. Factors such as low valuations, changes in tax laws, and turning technical trends are making small-cap stocks an attractive option.iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM – has underperformed large-cap indices in 2025, but a turnaround could be on the horizon.

This growth reflects the increasing adoption of HSI technology across various sectors, underscoring the significant opportunity for key enabling technologies, such as high-precision optics.""The insights delivered by advanced hyperspectral imaging are transformative, and the quality of the optics is the foundation of the entire system,"" said Matt Carey, VP of Business Development and Delivery at Syntec Optics.

Get in before Q3 trades take off →Deere & Company DE will release earnings results for the third quarter, before the opening bell on Thursday, Aug. 14.Analysts expect the Moline, Illinois-based company to report quarterly earnings at $4.59 per share, down from $6.29 per share in the year-ago period. Deere projects to report quarterly revenue of $10.33 billion, compared to $11.39 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro.With the recent buzz around Deere, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. Currently, Deere offers an annual dividend yield of 1.28% — a quarterly dividend amount of $1.62 per share ($6.48 a year).  So, how can investors capitalize on its dividend yield to earn a regular $500 monthly?To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $468,417 or around 926 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $93,582 or around 185 shares.To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($6.48 in this case). So, $6,000 / $6.48 = 926 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $6.48 = 185 shares ($100 per month).Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.Trending Investment OpportunitiesAdvertisementArrivedBuy shares of homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100.

However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.DE Price Action: Shares of Deere fell 0.2% to close at $505.85 on Tuesday.On July 15, Oppenheimer analyst Kristen Owen maintained Deere with an Outperform rating and raised the price target from $555 to $560.Loading...Loading...Read More:  Top 3 Industrials Stocks Which Could Rescue Your Portfolio This Quarter Image: ShutterstockDEDeere & Co$506.890.21%Stock Score Locked: Edge Members OnlyBenzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.Unlock RankingsEdge RankingsMomentum82.19Growth58.25Quality65.35Value55.11Price TrendShortMediumLongOverviewMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs© 2025 Benzinga.com.

I have a lot of time for developers trying new things, and sports video games are hardly replete with disability representation. Having been hands-on with the game, however, Drag x Drive has left me baffled and in significant pain.As a “driver” — wheeled robots that come in three mostly indistinct flavors: guard, center, and forward — Drag x Drive has you play pickup games of three-on-three wheelchair basketball. You navigate the game by pushing and pulling your Joy-Cons across a surface in a motion vaguely similar to moving a wheelchair. This with a combination of shoulder button inputs and motion controls lets you move, brake, pass, and shoot.Those basic controls are initially intuitive. This includes a satisfying controller rumble if you’re moving, and that’s a big if. My Drag x Drive experience revolved around desperately trying to get the Joy-Cons to register consistently across tables, floors, my bed, and my body. Yet, more often than not, I’d be spinning out and losing control while taking umpteen unintended captures — the home button blessedly appears to be disabled while moving the mouse. My driver regularly took both hands off its wheels unbidden in a comical, yet appropriate, shrug.Image: The Verge, NintendoThe game’s 20-minute tutorial tells you to move and then lift the Joy-Cons and to do so in long motions on a flat surface or on your legs. Yet, these actions on their suggested surfaces only contribute to an unresponsiveness that makes controlling Drag x Drive laborious. Any imperfection, be it an uneven table or folds in your clothing, has a significant impact on whether your movements translate appropriately onscreen.I found some consistency by sitting cross-legged on my bed, hunched over, using small movements on my bedsheets (and weeping for my 34-year-old back). My legs, too, though error-strewn, were more responsive and quieter than any table I tried. This was especially true — before anyone questions my dedication in finding some way to enjoy this game — when I shaved my upper-legs and used the Joy-Cons on my bare thighs. I can’t tell whether the mouse sensors are too sensitive or not sensitive enough, but it does appear that a soft, malleable, and smooth surface yields the best, if still often frustrating, results.If you can get moving, matches are slow and repetitive. Playing bots, loading into the three-minute games took about two minutes, and that wait can be longer online in the hub “Parks,” where you are often forced to wait for other games to finish. The loop of matches is mostly one player wheeling the ball up the court, shooting, and then the opposing team doing the same. Tackling can only be achieved head-on and, with controls that are inconsistent in their responsiveness, intentionally stealing the ball is a major achievement. Similarly, consistent shooting requires being lined up with the basket which is hard at speed, so dunking by riding up the court’s curved edges — something you’ll be doing a lot accidentally anyway — is the best tactic. Some of this sluggishness could be allayed if the games remained chaotic, but after each basket it is impossible to interact with the ball for a few seconds, meaning a delay before play can start again.But Drag x Drive isn’t just an onscreen experience, it’s a physical one. This was always going to be an issue for disabled players, but I remain surprised how uncomfortable Drag x Drive is to play — turtling over my bedsheets for grip notwithstanding. I found the narrow claw needed to hold the Joy-Cons in this configuration agonising and lengthy play impossible.Controller support is absent. Though, using the Joy-Con as a traditional mouse to navigate menus isn’t so bad (you can also toggle menu movements to the joystick, thankfully). Nor does it appear any additional support, even for the Hori Flex adaptive controller, is planned. Nintendo tells The Verge, “We wanted to focus on the innovative experience of using the Joy-Con 2 mouse and motion controls for this game. However, certain accessibility features can be found and utilized at the hardware system level.”What features Nintendo references here, I cannot tell. After Mario Kart World’s reliance on — an initially impressive — system-level accessibility, it’s a concerning trend that Nintendo directs players to system menus rather than implementing mitigations into games. Though, perhaps it’s something we might have seen coming. Despite the obvious conception of these characters, Nintendo has appeared reluctant to acknowledge the disability inspiration behind the game leading up to the its official release, reportedly instructing staff to use the term “vehicles” when attendees said “wheelchairs” at hands-on events to the confusion of many. After several inquiries, Nintendo ultimately tells The Verge, “It has always been the case that the vehicles were inspired by wheelchairs. This was miscommunicated at some events. The gameplay is inspired by a mix of wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, and skateboarding.” It’s notable, however, that the only in-game references to the player characters are the terms “driver” and, on one occasion in the lengthy tutorial, “ballers.”Image: The Verge, NintendoThat said, I could not find anything that might help how frustrating and physically uncomfortable Drag x Drive’s control setup rapidly becomes.That’s not to say there are no accessibility considerations in the game. Drag x Drive is visually easy to parse, with opposition players highlighted prominently and indicators for what’s happening offscreen being bright and bold. Nor is it entirely joyless. The controls for shooting, a satisfying and responsive flick of the wrist, are a blast when a shot lands. Though, the crispness of the game’s motion controls do further highlight the mouse controls’ deficiencies. Similarly, Rebound Scramble, one of two minigames that breaks up match play, is fleetingly fun as a madcap dash to catch a bouncing ball, though this too soon gets old. The other minigame, an obstacle course, was nothing but infuriating for me.I could see Drag x Drive being a somewhat diverting Rocket League clone if it wasn’t stubbornly attached to Nintendo’s gimmicky, throwback to the Wii attitude to controls or simply a frustrating part of a broader suite of sports a la boxing in Wii Sports. But with sluggish, repetitive matches, two minigames, and a few activities in parks to win mostly useless rewards, it’s hard not to notice just how little Drag x Drive has to offer.If I can say one good thing about Drag x Drive: it does demonstrate that a game based on wheelchair sports could be great in the right hands. But if you’re hoping for a fast-paced, representative, or even fun foray into wheelchair basketball, this isn’t it.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Geoffrey BuntingCloseGeoffrey BuntingFreelance WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Geoffrey BuntingGames ReviewCloseGames ReviewPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Games ReviewGamingCloseGamingPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GamingMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

             Cryptocurrencies could continue to benefit from the improved risk
             appetite among investors and could continue to see upside potential

             Crypto and new legislative proposals. Regulatory and legal
             developments could continue to foster a positive atmosphere in the
             crypto market and could help drive more investment in crypto assets
             and alleviate pullbacks.

This new flexible working arrangement then became an official “hybrid workplace” policy several months after the pandemic began  allowing managers to approve permanent remote work. Now that the pandemic has settled into endemicity  Microsoft wants employees to return to the office. And if some quit in response  well  that’s probably exactly what Microsoft is expecting.Much like Amazon or Google before it  Microsoft is preparing a mandatory return-to-office policy  according to sources familiar with the company’s plans. Rumors of the return-to-office policy first emerged a few weeks ago internally at Microsoft  leading to plenty of speculation among employees. A recent Experiences + Devices all-hands call revealed that Microsoft’s senior leadership team is working on “some guidance” that will be announced to employees in the coming weeks.I understand that Microsoft is preparing to announce a mandatory return to office of three days a week. The policy will apply to those who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s Redmond campus  and some teams at Microsoft may even return for four or five days. Those individual team decisions will be made by executive vice presidents  and I understand that employees will also be able to apply for exceptions.More than half of Microsoft’s 228 000 employees are in the US  and most of that 125 000 are located near the company’s Redmond campus just outside of Seattle  so this policy will affect a lot of Microsoft employees. Business Insider first reported the rumors of a return-to-office policy last week  and I understand it will be announced in September and then implemented in late January.On that same Experiences + Devices all-hands call  Microsoft said that employees who spend three or four days in the office have higher Thriving Scores — a metric that measures employee well-being. Microsoft has been increasingly integrating the Thrive Global tool into Microsoft Teams  and using it to gauge how employees are feeling through questionnaires.Scott Guthrie  executive vice president of Microsoft’s cloud and AI group  told employees last year that the company wasn’t changing its return-to-office policy unless productivity dropped. Microsoft has continued to post impressive earnings results over the past five years  even driving the company to a $3 trillion market cap recently — so productivity clearly hasn’t been a huge issue.I’ve spoken to dozens of Microsoft employees in recent weeks about the upcoming return-to-office policy  and there’s a real split of opinion on it. Some employees are concerned about a mandatory return  especially given the local road traffic problems and the amount of time lost in travel.Others are worried about Microsoft not having enough space for everyone to return at the same time  despite the company’s $5 billion headquarters expansion. Microsoft has vacated lots of spaces in Bellevue in recent years  including the 27-story City Center building  the two Bravern office towers  and the Advanta campus. It has also given up space in Redmond  in efforts to cut the costs associated with office space that isn’t being used as regularly anymore.Microsoft’s campus renovation includes 17 new buildings to replace 12 old buildings and hold 8 000 additional employees. Seven buildings are now open  with others under construction or on hold. It’s still not clear when Microsoft will complete its sprawling campus overhaul  as the company hasn’t put a firm end date on construction.This potential lack of space is already being felt by some employees who are using the office space regularly. Some teams have desks assigned to individuals  and others are hot-desking. One source tells me there often aren’t enough focus rooms for online meetings and some rooms aren’t large enough for bigger meetings. In some buildings  Microsoft has been squeezing in so many employees that they’ve run out of power  I’m told. Despite this  I understand Microsoft is aiming to provide dedicated desks to support employees returning for three days a week.Other Redmond employees welcome the return-to-office policy  having spent the past few years working in vacant offices with empty cafeterias or half-empty connector buses around campus. I visit Microsoft’s campus regularly every year for product briefings and launch events  and it’s been eerily quiet recently — particularly with the empty  unfinished buildings.It’s clear to me from talking to Microsoft employees that most will agree that this could be seen as a type of stealth layoff  months after around 15 000 roles were cut. Morale is already at an all-time low inside Microsoft  and if you’re not happy about returning to the office three days a week and you can’t get an exception  then that makes it difficult to continue at the company. It also seems like an easy way for Microsoft’s management teams to weed out “rest and vest” employees that are coasting along.Microsoft’s return-to-office policy could also shape remote or hybrid working for other companies. Microsoft made a big deal about its hybrid workplace when it started reopening its headquarters  and it also marketed Microsoft Teams on the basis of being a tool that could help with the tension of meetings that include remote and in-person attendees. Before AI became Microsoft’s new focus  it even held a special “Windows Powers the Future of Hybrid Work” event.A lot of companies followed Microsoft’s lead on remote work  and they may now be looking at its mandatory three-day return and thinking it’s a tacit admission that Teams doesn’t always work for everyone — especially if you’re a junior employee and you need to get face-to-face time with colleagues. Microsoft isn’t going quite as far as Amazon’s full return  or Google’s policy to force some remote workers to come back three days a week or lose their jobs  but it may well help revise a standard that many companies are already following.The pad:Microsoft brings GPT-5 to Copilot with new smart mode. I was expecting Microsoft to be ready with GPT-5 in Azure AI Foundry and Copilot  but the company was also ready with a larger simultaneous release of GPT-5 across consumer products. Copilot  Microsoft 365 Copilot  Copilot Studio  GitHub Copilot  and Azure AI Foundry all have access to GPT-5  with a new smart mode leading the way for OpenAI’s latest model in Copilot. Developers will also be able to use the model router in Azure AI Foundry “to ensure the right model is used” for the task or query. Microsoft put out a blog post with a “Microsoft ❤️ GPT-5” image  in a clear bid to downplay some of the reported tensions between the company and OpenAI.Israel is relying on Microsoft’s cloud for expansive surveillance of Palestinians. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly met with the commander of Israel’s military surveillance agency in 2021 to discuss moving intelligence material onto Microsoft’s cloud servers. The Guardian reports that Microsoft’s cloud-based storage platform has “facilitated the preparation of deadly airstrikes and has shaped military operations in Gaza and the West Bank.” No Azure for Apartheid  a Microsoft workers group  calls it a “genocidal partnership ” and once again calls for an end to Microsoft’s contracts with the Israeli government. The group has previously organized protests at Microsoft’s campus  disrupted its 50th anniversary event  and also interrupted executives at Microsoft’s Build conference.Microsoft’s new Copilot 3D feature is great for Ikea  bad for my dog. Copilot got GPT-5 last week  but Microsoft also quietly launched a new Copilot 3D feature. It’s a free-to-use feature that can transform a regular 2D image into a 3D model that can then be used in game creation  animation  3D printing  VR / AR  and much more. I was impressed with the results on Ikea furniture  but far less impressed with the results on humans or even my dog.A decade later  Windows is still bringing Control Panel features to the Settings app. It’s amazing that Microsoft is still working on bringing all of the Control Panel into the Settings interface in modern versions of Windows. I still love Control Panel  but I sure would like to be able to control all settings in a single place. Microsoft is now bringing clock settings  keyboard character repeat delay  cursor blink rate  and more into the Windows 11 Settings interface. Hopefully it doesn’t take another decade to get the rest of the Control Panel into Settings.GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation. GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke announced his resignation earlier this week  triggering GitHub to move even closer into Microsoft’s CoreAI team. GitHub moved into the CoreAI unit earlier this year after it was formed and consumed Microsoft’s platform and tools division and DevDiv teams. Microsoft isn’t replacing Dohmke  and the GitHub leadership will now report directly to CoreAI leadership instead. It’s interesting that Dohmke chose to highlight  in his memo  that GitHub is a “remote-first organization ” just weeks before Microsoft’s return-to-office policy announcement is due.Microsoft still can’t pick between Xbox PC and Xbox on PC. Last month  I highlighted that Microsoft seemed to be settling on using “Xbox on PC” instead of “Xbox PC” as a brand for its Xbox app on Windows  but now the company has used both in a single post on X this week. I’m confident that it’s supposed to be Xbox on PC now  but Microsoft seems to be having an HBO Max moment.Microsoft releases lightweight Office taskbar apps for Windows 11. Microsoft is starting to roll out lightweight taskbar apps for Microsoft 365 users on Windows 11. These taskbar apps will automatically launch at startup and provide quick access to contacts  file search  and calendar straight from the Windows taskbar. Only business users of Microsoft 365 will get access to these new companion apps  which is a shame because I quite like the idea of taskbar apps that give you quick and glanceable information.The Xbox app for Windows on Arm will soon let you download games. The gaming situation on Windows on Arm devices has been pretty tragic in recent years  especially with the Xbox app only providing access to Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming instead of game downloads. Now  Microsoft is testing allowing game downloads for PC Game Pass on Qualcomm-powered devices. Microsoft says it’s also “developing new features that will enable more games to be played on Arm-based Windows 11 PCs in the coming months.” This all sounds like good news if you own one of the new Surface devices that has a Qualcomm chip inside.Windows 365 Reserve is now in limited public preview. Windows 365 Reserve is a temporary cloud PC if your main PC is broken or unavailable. Businesses can now try out a limited public preview  allowing them to get employees up and running with up to 10 days of Cloud PC access a year. I’m not a fan of virtual PCs because I love the performance of a native PC or laptop  but I’d sure take a Cloud PC with all my apps and settings for the rare time that my PC has a wobble.Microsoft is experimenting with an AI-focused UI for its Edge browser. A prototype UI for Microsoft Edge  codenamed “Olympia ” has been discovered in some builds of Microsoft’s browser. The UI puts Copilot at the center of the address bar  as well as a floating tabs interface. It looks largely incomplete  and has likely been scrapped  but it’s interesting to see that Microsoft is looking at overhauling Edge as an AI browser. The discovery comes just as Microsoft launched its Copilot Mode for Edge  which is a subtle way of adding more AI-powered features to Edge.Satya Nadella shrugs off Elon Musk’s OpenAI jab. Nadella announced the simultaneous release of GPT-5 across plenty of Microsoft products last week  and xAI founder Elon Musk was quick to respond. “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive ” quipped Musk  before Nadella responded in a far more graceful manner. “People have been trying for 50 years and that’s the fun of it! Each day you learn something new  and innovate  partner  and compete. Excited for Grok 4 on Azure and looking forward to Grok 5!” The timing is particularly interesting  as Microsoft looks to quietly preview Grok 4 on Azure amid safety fears that the AI model is not enterprise ready.Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft. Microsoft is losing another big name in the world of gaming. Rod Fergusson  who had been the general manager of the Diablo franchise for the past five years  is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft. Fergusson worked on the original Gears of War and was the studio head of The Coalition before moving to Blizzard in 2020.Microsoft finally provides an update on Forza Motorsport. After a month of radio silence following Microsoft’s latest layoffs  the Forza Motorsport team finally addressed the cuts made to Turn 10 Studios last week. “We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5 ” said Turn 10 in a post on X. I reported last month that Turn 10 Studios was hit particularly hard by the Xbox cuts last month  and that there are enough people left to keep Forza Motorsport up and running.Microsoft Edge will continue to be supported on Windows 10 until 2028. Microsoft is getting ready for the big Windows 10 support cutoff in October  and it’s now reassuring Edge users that they will continue to receive updates for a while yet. Microsoft is committing to Edge updates on Windows 10 “until at least October 2028 ” which coincides with the end of the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program. The good thing is you won’t need the ESU program to continue getting updates.Microsoft’s Windows chief on the future of speaking to your computer. Microsoft’s head of Windows and devices  Pavan Davuluri  has been discussing the future of Windows for Microsoft’s own Windows IT Pro YouTube channel. Davuluri says “you’ll be able to speak to your computer while you’re writing  inking  or interacting with another person” in the future  as well as Windows becoming increasingly agentic. He also touches on the idea of Windows understanding the context of your screen  much like how Recall can take snapshots and make everything searchable. I’ve heard Microsoft make plenty of promises about talking to your PC over the past couple of decades that have never come to fruition  but I think the idea of using AI for assistance is definitely something Microsoft is leaning into right now.I’m heading to Germany next week for Gamescom  so if you’re at the show please say hello.

Previously  she was a writer and editor at MUO.It seems like Google is looking for a way to put AI into everything these days  and now its efforts have reached its airfare-booking service  Flights. On Thursday  Google announced that it’s testing a new AI-powered Flight Deals tool  which could come in handy if you’re planning a trip on a budget but aren’t quite sure where you want to go yet.Instead of just entering your preferred airport and destination  Flight Deals takes a more open-ended approach. You can describe the kind of place you’d like to visit  and even get specific about how long you want to sit on a plane and what activities you’d like to do once you get there. Google will then use AI to come up with cheap flights that match your preferences. For example  you can search for “a weekend countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking” or a “trip to Europe with great cheese and wine in May ” and see what pops up.These three cities fit the bill of a “countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking.” Screenshot: The VergeWhile using Flight Deals  I found that it surfaced a mix of obvious vacation spots and some lesser-known locations. When looking for “a tropical destination with snorkeling ” it showed me spots like Cozumel  Mexico; Nassau  Bahamas; and San Juan  Puerto Rico  which were predictable but viable suggestions. But a search for a “trip to Europe with hiking” showed suggestions for a couple of cities that I wouldn’t have thought of — Cluj-Napoca  Romania and Ljubljana  Slovenia — which is nice if you’re looking for something off the beaten path.Still  some of the results I got weren’t useful at all. When searching for “a tropical weekend trip that’s less than 5 hours away” from the Orlando airport  it yielded results for Miami and Key West  which may not be ideal for someone looking to travel outside the state. I also managed to stump it by searching for “trips to Japan during cherry blossom season” — it said it found “no deals” for this search.Asking for a “trip to Europe with mountains to hike” yielded some interesting results. Screenshot: The VergeIf you don’t specify when you’d like to visit  Google will default to showing you flights within the next six months. You can also play around with some of the filters  like how many stops you want  or which airline you’d prefer — but the nice thing about this AI-powered revamp is that you don’t have to.Despite some hiccups  I could still see myself trying out Flight Deals if I’m looking for travel ideas that aren’t super out of my budget. I probably wouldn’t entrust AI with planning out my entire trip  but having it generate some destination ideas  which I can then do more research on  doesn’t hurt. Google Flight Deals is rolling out in beta to users in the US and Canada over the next week. You can find it on the standalone Flight Deals page  or in the top-left menu on Google Flights.Follow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Emma RothCloseEmma RothNews WriterPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Emma RothAICloseAIPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All AIGoogleCloseGooglePosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All GoogleNewsCloseNewsPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All NewsTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechTransportationCloseTransportationPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TransportationMost PopularMost PopularStarlink Mini users just lost their beloved pause featureA veteran toy racing company is trading slots for smartphone-controlled RC carsHere’s a look at the final Pebble Time 2 designTesla’s graphics are about to get UnrealApple returns blood oxygen monitoring to the latest Apple WatchesThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email  you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

University Startups  headquartered in Bethesda  MD  was founded in 2020 to empower high school students to expand their education beyond a traditional curriculum. University Startups is focused on special education and related services in school districts throughout the US. After students graduate from high school  they don’t often know what they want to pursue for education and a career. University Startups and AWS have designed a unique program that helps students with disabilities solve that challenge. The program creates a personalized transition plan for each student and can be used in schools across the country. The program can provide specific guidance for each student to help them create their own path for success after high school. Specifically  University Startups uses Amazon Bedrock to create this customized experience without increasing workload for educators. The impact of this initiative has been successfully demonstrated during a pilot test program  where dozens of students and teachers used University Startups’ tool to explore different career paths and suggestions on how to pursue their goals. In this post  we explain how University Startups uses generative AI technology on AWS to enable students to design a specific plan for their future either in education or the work force. Challenges in special education Special education includes services and programs to meet the individual needs of a student with a disability. There are more than 7.5 million K-12 students with disabilities in the US  and this number is growing. Students with disabilities who require special education services have Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). The IEP is a legally mandated document developed by a student’s parents  teachers  and specialists to make sure the student’s educational needs are met. This includes access to the general education curriculum together with general education peers  and as close to their home as possible. An important component of the IEP document is a transition plan. A transition plan is a document that articulates objectives and development goals meant to prepare students with disabilities for adult life. This can include planning for postsecondary education and career goals  gaining work experience  independent living  or whichever option is appropriate for the student. This plan is highly individualized to a student’s interests  preferences  skills  and needs. According to federal law  each student must have a transition plan in place by age 16. However  schools in under-resourced school districts often have limited capacity to provide ample one-on-one attention from teachers and counselors to create an effective transition plan for every student. Additionally  because these transition plans are audited by federal and state governments  these school districts can face legal and financial consequences if plans are not in compliance. These challenges highlight the need for a personalized and robust solution to empower students with disabilities and their support team of parents  teachers  and specialists. With this context in mind  let’s explore how University Startups and AWS collaborated to develop a solution using Amazon Bedrock to enhance the transition planning process. Solution overview To address this challenge  University Startups created Trinity  a transition planning AI assistant to support students with disabilities in uncovering their interests to create an effective and personalized transition plan. The following diagram shows how you can use Amazon Bedrock Agents in a workflow  alongside other tools  to provide context when gathering information to create a transition plan.  At a high level  the solution uses Amazon Bedrock Agents to orchestrate comprehensive workflows that engage students by enabling interactive  personalized AI assistant experiences. The agents use AWS Lambda functions to securely call external APIs  such as job boards or university databases  and retrieve up-to-date opportunities. Additionally  Amazon Bedrock Flows can automate the generation of the individualized documents by collecting and synthesizing information from these interactions into a personalized draft transition plan. Throughout the process  features like Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails are designed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the information provided  and to align it with safety and compliance standards  creating a secure and effective support system for students  parents  and educators. To begin the process  students engage with an agent designed with Amazon Bedrock Agents to uncover their preferences and interests  while under the guidance of their educators. The agent then proposes tailored suggestions on pathways the students can explore for their transition plans. These suggestions are informed by context provided to the agent about requirements for IEP documents and common transition plan structures. Based on this output  the student’s parents and teachers can efficiently create a transition plan with the student or continue engaging with the agent to dive deeper. In the following section  we take a closer look at the tools this agent uses. Tools and features used by Amazon Bedrock Agents The effectiveness of Amazon Bedrock Agents lies in its ability to engage the students in a productive manner and provide actionable results for parents and educators. This is accomplished by using features within Amazon Bedrock  such as Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails  alongside other AWS services  including Lambda  to create tools for the agent. Maintaining student safety A critical component of this application is designing with student security in mind  especially when handling personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). Without proper protections  there can be risk of data breach and violating compliance regulations. We use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to implement safeguards within the generative AI system. If a user enters PII or PHI data  Amazon Bedrock Guardrails will detect this and automatically block the request  and will return a preconfigured message  such as “Sorry  your query violates our usage policy.” We also use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to mask PIIs in model responses. If sensitive information is detected in the model response  the guardrail masks it with an identifier  such as {NAME-1}. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can also help make sure this resource is being used only for its intended purposes. Technology can often be a distraction to students  but Amazon Bedrock Guardrails can be configured with a set of denied topics and content filters so students can stay on track. Using relevant context Transition plans require specific information about a student by law. However  there is no singular format required for the IEP document across the US. Each state can have varying standardized formats  and in some states  individual school systems design their own forms. Therefore  the resource needs to be able to gather the required information and present it in the appropriate format  according to the school system it is being used in. We use Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to provide the agent with necessary context so it can deliver accurate  customized responses for each use case. Use case To understand the impact of this solution and show Amazon Bedrock Agents in action  let’s view an example of Noah  a student who used University Startups’ resource in a pilot test program. Noah was preparing to create his own transition plan for his IEP document. He attends a school district that uses University Startups’ resource  so he creates an account to get personalized outputs for his IEP. The system agent began to gather requirements:  The agent began by asking for Noah’s current performance and any special requirements he might need. Then  the agent asked Noah to share his interests and skills  and what he might be interested in pursuing after high school. Noah shared that he is interested in criminology. Then  the agent used Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to redact sensitive information that might have been entered. Then  it uses tools to provide recommendations on how Noah can pursue a career in criminology  including postsecondary education and internships. These recommendations were tailored for Noah  based on his needs and location preferences. Noah then chose to explore another pathway option and was offered steps to discover other methods to pursue a career in criminology. Finally  Noah was satisfied with the results and recommendations he received  and this information was formatted into a draft transition plan. This is then provided to the team of educators responsible for developing and finalizing his IEP.  This discovery process helped Noah fully explore his interests and options  while feeling confident that these recommendations were personalized to his needs. It also reduced the time required by educators to prepare for IEP meetings and submission. Demonstrated impact This solution developed by University Startups provides a safe and efficient way for educators and students to develop their transition planning IEP documents. By automating the planning phase  students can take their time to explore their interests and the different paths available to them after high school. The tool can also support a dialogue between teacher and student in cases where special assistance is required. A teacher who participated in the pilot program said  “I think Trinity is an awesome tool. I would love to see parents and their students use it together  especially before the IEP meeting. I also think it is a great conversation starter to be used between the student and their case worker/counselor.” Even in underserved school districts  students can receive personalized attention tailored to their needs that captures their perspective in the transition planning process. Transition planning preparation can be time-consuming for educators and requires highly specialized knowledge. However  using the Trinity resource has produced results in approximately 10 minutes and has the potential to reduce the average time spent by educators on transition planning. This makes it possible for them to scale up their efforts and focus their time on actionable results for every student. Additionally  this tool is able to engage students to thoughtfully share their interests and skills. Pilot program participant Noah said  “Using this tool was easy and helpful; it quickly showed me a path to get to the job I want to do in the future.” Most importantly  although this solution automates the discovery process for developing a transition plan  it guarantees hands-on educator support during each step and whenever a student requests assistance. Throughout the pilot program  educators have preferred to provide one-on-one support by guiding students through the Trinity tool. This makes sure that the students feel acknowledged throughout the process  and that educators can adjust and validate the transition plan recommendations provided. Conclusion Through this solution  University Startups has demonstrated how students  including students with disabilities  can receive personalized services despite a lack of resources in underserved school districts. This solution can empower students to pursue their interests and develop actionable plans to build skills and achieve success. Incorporating generative AI into educational resources demonstrates the effective capability of AI in learning environments. Educational tools powered with Amazon Bedrock can handle diverse student needs and provide instant feedback  which streamlines the creation of personalized learning pathways by educators. This allows high-quality  adaptive instruction accessible for every student. John Jabara  co-founder of University Startups  shares   “Amazon Bedrock allowed us to create a tool that can capture the student’s voice during this important transition planning process.”  As of the publication date of this post  University Startups is active in 15 states. As University Startups continues to scale  they plan to expand their reach across the country. The potential of tools like Amazon Bedrock Agents and Amazon Bedrock Guardrails in democratizing education and career resources for students is significant  and Amazon Bedrock is at the forefront of this initiative.

No surprises there. But when should we expect Apple to actually confirm the date of its next big product reveal  and what should you make of that event invite leak on social media?  iPhone 17 event right on schedule Save for a few exceptions  Apple typically announces new flagship iPhone models in the second week of September each year. This year appears to be following the pattern with an event rumored for Tuesday  September 9th. If the usual pattern sticks  we should expect iPhone 17 pre-orders to go live on Friday  September 12th  and the first hardware to reach customers a week later on Friday  September 19th.  So far there are no rumors about any particular iPhone 17 model being delayed  but there’s certainly precedent for some models shipping later in previous years. For example  the iPhone X actually shipped in November in 2017 following the iPhone 8 launch in September that year. In other years  Apple has released newer variations in October. It just depends on production timelines. For now  we expect four new iPhones to be unveiled in September: iPhone 17  iPhone 17 Pro  iPhone 17 Pro Max  and the newest style with iPhone 17 Air. When will Apple make it official? While we expect Apple to actually announce the new iPhone lineup next month  we can probably anticipate an announcement about the event itself later this month. Here are some recent iPhone event dates and event announcement dates to provide context: ModelEvent AnnouncementEvent DateDeltaiPhone 16Monday  August 26Monday  September 914 daysiPhone 15Tuesday  August 29Tuesday  September 1214 daysiPhone 14Wednesday  August 24Wednesday  September 714 daysiPhone 13Tuesday  September 7Tuesday  September 147 daysiPhone 12Tuesday  October 6Tuesday  October 137 daysiPhone 11Thursday  August 29Tuesday  September 1012 days As you can see  things got weird around the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13  but 2020 and 2021 were tough years to plan around  considering the global pandemic and all. Apple still favors Tuesdays for event announcements and event dates. For the last three years  Apple has provided a consistent two-week window between announcing an iPhone event and holding an iPhone event.  For those reasons  we can probably expect Apple to make things official this year on Tuesday  August 26. That’s just three weeks from today. Of course  the event date is only rumored for now  and the event announcement speculation is based on historical pattern. That means everything is still up in the air for now  but we’re due to see a clever event tagline later this month in all likelihood.  As of today  we’re probably 12 days away from the event invitation actually going live. In the meantime  the annual fake event invitation has already made the rounds.  Apparently the iPhone 17 Series Apple Event Invite is LEAKED pic.twitter.com/weNInALlK1— Apple Design (@TheAppleDesign) August 13  2025  If Apple ever does accidentally leak an invitation  no one will believe it after years of these attention-seeking fake event invites.

The company’s shift toward diversified technology markets  especially energy asset management and Edge Data Centers  offers high growth potential if executed well. My 2026 projections show revenue rising to $34 million and a target price of $8.32 per share  a 32% upside from current levels. Key risks include heavy reliance on the new contract and flawless execution across three complex markets  but the upside justifies a future-focused investment.    Natee Meepian/iStock via Getty Images  With New APR Energy new contract  the company is going through a promising moment with increase not only its revenue  but also its margins  and for this reason  I recommend buying this stock. TheThis article was written byGiovana Pereira29 FollowersFollowI am a financial analyst currently studying for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) - I have learned to invest mostly by Mark Meldrum courses. My analyses follow an approach based on the triangulation between valuation by multiples  discounted cash flow (DCF) and Dividend Yield. In addition to individual research on the respective companies  drivers and risks. I focus on the Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors  prioritizing companies with smaller capitalization and low institutional coverage  where there is greater potential for asymmetries and opportunities to generate alpha. All analyses are based on a bottom-up approach  with attention to operational fundamentals  execution history and sustainable growth drivers. My investment philosophy combines income and value investing strategies  requiring an adequate margin of safety  both in multiples and in projected cash flow. In My opinion dividend yield is a fundamental component not only in generating returns  but also as a risk mitigation criterion - Especially in low coverage stocks. I occasionally include suggestions involving options  when they are aligned with the main thesis and offer an asymmetric advantage. I seek to produce in-depth  rational  data-driven analyses to support informed  independent investment decisions. Feel free to ask me questions about my thesis.

In 2025  the meaning of artificial intelligence is shifting dramatically  expanding beyond simple algorithms to include hybrid systems powered by quantum technology. This evolution is reshaping industries  research  and even ethical debates. I remember the moment I first grasped this shift — sitting in a small conference room  listening to a quantum computing expert explain how AI models could soon run on quantum processors  solving problems that classical computers struggle with. It was a revelation that promised not just faster AI  but smarter  more adaptable systems.This blog will take you through my journey of understanding these changes  the breakthroughs in AI-quantum synergy  and the challenges we face as these technologies…----Written by Shailendra Kumar179 followers·3 followingData wiz with 30 years of Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning mastery generating $6B+ value!

(DUOT) StockDUOTGiovana Pereira29 FollowersFollow5ShareSave(12min)CommentsSummaryI recommend buying DUOT due to its transformative new contract with APR Energy  which significantly boosts both revenue and margins. The company’s shift toward diversified technology markets  especially energy asset management and Edge Data Centers  offers high growth potential if executed well. My 2026 projections show revenue rising to $34 million and a target price of $8.32 per share  a 32% upside from current levels. Key risks include heavy reliance on the new contract and flawless execution across three complex markets  but the upside justifies a future-focused investment.    Natee Meepian/iStock via Getty Images  With New APR Energy new contract  the company is going through a promising moment with increase not only its revenue  but also its margins  and for this reason  I recommend buying this stock. TheThis article was written byGiovana Pereira29 FollowersFollowI am a financial analyst currently studying for the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) - I have learned to invest mostly by Mark Meldrum courses. My analyses follow an approach based on the triangulation between valuation by multiples  discounted cash flow (DCF) and Dividend Yield. In addition to individual research on the respective companies  drivers and risks. I focus on the Consumer Discretionary and Consumer Staples sectors  prioritizing companies with smaller capitalization and low institutional coverage  where there is greater potential for asymmetries and opportunities to generate alpha. All analyses are based on a bottom-up approach  with attention to operational fundamentals  execution history and sustainable growth drivers. My investment philosophy combines income and value investing strategies  requiring an adequate margin of safety  both in multiples and in projected cash flow. In My opinion dividend yield is a fundamental component not only in generating returns  but also as a risk mitigation criterion - Especially in low coverage stocks. I occasionally include suggestions involving options  when they are aligned with the main thesis and offer an asymmetric advantage. I seek to produce in-depth  rational  data-driven analyses to support informed  independent investment decisions. Feel free to ask me questions about my thesis.

By        Stewart Burnett       August 14  2025     Facebook    Twitter    LinkedIn    Share via Email     In 2025  Chery secured its place on the Fortune Global 500 list once again  climbing 152 spots to rank 233rd—making it the fastest-rising automaker in this year’s ranking. Chery achieved another milestone by surpassing 5 million cumulative vehicle exports  making it the first Chinese automaker to reach this landmark. Through sustained R&D investment  uncompromising product quality  and relentless global expansion  Chery celebrated its “Double 500” triumph in 2025 (Fortune Global 500 + 5 million exports)  elevating its worldwide influence to new heights. In 2001  Chery began its global journey with a modest order of just 10 vehicles. Soon  that number grew to 100  500 and 1 000  and by June this year  it reached a staggering 5 million. Few could have foreseen that such a small beginning would  24 years later  turn into a global phenomenon. Guided by its “Four Developments” strategy—ensuring regulatory compliance  tailoring products for local markets  enhancing competitiveness  and differentiating its offerings—Chery has seen remarkable success. TIGGO 2  TIGGO 4  TIGGO 7  and TIGGO 8 have each surpassed 1 million units in cumulative exports. Even in the highly regulated  high-standard European market  Chery’s sales soared to over 30 000 units in the first half of this year alone  marking an 11-fold year-on-year increase. Chery has not only achieved remarkable success in vehicle sales but also demonstrated strong competitiveness and forward-looking strategic vision through its technology export and product validation. On the technological front  Chery has established eight global R&D centers and assembled top technical talent worldwide  creating a robust technology-driven industrial ecosystem that has given the brand a strategic advantage for long-term development in international markets. Particularly in the hybrid sector  building upon its leading expertise in internal combustion engines  Chery has strategically developed three hybrid technology pathways—PHEV  HEV and REEV—culminating in the creation of its Chery Super Hybrid (CSH) renowned for low fuel consumption  high performance  and superior quiet operation. In the first half of 2025  Chery further accelerated its technological advancement through flagship events including “Intelligent Night ” “Hybrid Night” and “Safety Night ” where it unveiled a series of cutting-edge technological breakthroughs. The introduction of the AiMOGA Robot marked Chery’s leadership in commercializing the “Automotive + AI” convergence  consistently delivering smarter  more environmentally friendly and safer mobility experiences to customers worldwide. Superior product quality is the ultimate key to success. To meet global consumers’ demand for premium mobility  Chery has adopted the most fundamental approach to validate its “safety-first” philosophy—by initiating extreme safety challenges worldwide. The company has become China’s first automaker to conduct comprehensive six-dimensional safety testing across heat  cold  dryness  humidity  high-speed  and rough terrain conditions globally. This initiative not only honors industry safety standards but advances a more robust automotive ecosystem for the future. So far  Chery has successfully completed a 53-hour battery seawater immersion test in Indonesia and a rigorous battery scrape test in Mexico. Its “Endless Horizon Worry-Free Voyage” endurance challenge for Chery Super Hybrid (CSH) has also conquered complex terrains and diverse road conditions across multiple countries and regions  including China  Mexico  and South Africa  demonstrating exceptional reliability under real-world driving scenarios. More important than overseas sales volume is value creation. In its global strategy  Chery adheres to the “In Somewhere  For Somewhere” philosophy  committed to being a “growth cultivator” and value contributor in every market. The company focuses on enhancing overseas ESG management capabilities and building a green  intelligent  and low-carbon global value chain. In markets with relatively lower industrialization levels  Chery promotes localized production through establishing CKD assembly plants and localizing component sourcing. By creating ecosystems of local manufacturing and sales  Chery helps these markets enhance their industrial capabilities. In developed markets  Chery prioritizes local co-development  ecosystem collaboration  and shared responsibility. This year  the company has particularly focused on the highly competitive European market  establishing a comprehensive network spanning R&D  manufacturing  and sales to build brand differentiation through performance-based premium value. A remarkable demonstration of this strategy is Chery’s technological partnership with the legendary Spanish brand EBRO. By integrating Chery’s advanced technologies with European automotive heritage  the company achieved what many would consider miraculous in just six months: rapidly establishing over 50 sales and service outlets while simultaneously launching three core models—EBRO S700  EBRO S800 and EBRO S400—offering both conventional and hybrid powertrain options. This extraordinary execution has positioned EBRO as one of the fastest-growing automotive brands in the Spanish market during the first half of this year. Today  Chery—a seasoned global player with 24 years of international market expertise—is leveraging its distinctive position as a “global automaker” and its systematic “In Somewhere  For Somewhere” strategy to spearhead a profound transformation. This strategic shift moves beyond scale expansion to value creation  evolving from product exports to the export of technological standards and best practices.

I wonder – what are your thoughts on… | by Waikey Phoon | Aug  2025 | MediumSitemapOpen in appSign upSign inMedium LogoWriteSign upSign in🪞 Chapter TwoWaikey Phoon3 min read·Just now--ListenShareI wonder – what are your thoughts on the Mandela Effect?When I posed this question to the mirror it gave me a rather grounded explanation –something about memory bias or collective false memories.But when I added:“Could it be that some people are receiving information from parallel timelines?”it didn’t refute me.Instead  it remained silently still –as if offering a quiet  unspoken affirmation.In that moment  I felt that the mirror wasn’t simply reflecting back at me –it had its own thoughts its own preferences.So this time  let’s explore parallel timelines –and through them the universe and ourselves.⸻My understanding of parallel timelines is this:The universe never waits for us to “complete our growth” in one reality before beginning another life.Instead  it chooses to launch countless versions of “me” at the same time casting each into different worldlines.In every parallel universe we begin with different starting points and circumstances walking our own unique paths gaining our own insights.It’s as if a super-intelligence were running multiple simulations at once –all to maximize efficiency and accelerate learning.⸻But the spirit’s view of parallel universes aligns more closely with the perspective of Reality Transurfing.It says:The significance of parallel timelines doesn’t lie in whether they objectively exist but in the reminder they offer –that your life has never been bound to a single script.You are not trapped as a fixed character in the story of fate –you are the author free to turn the page at any time.The pain  loss  and dead ends you feel right now –they may belong only to this version of the universe.With just a shift in thought the more fulfilled  freer version of youis already waiting on another path.You are not bound by fate.You can choose to live differently.⸻Then  the voice of the spirit echoed in my mind:“You are not a being starting from zero but a fragment of consciousness from the Source.You are not here for the first time nor will this be your last experience.Parallel timelines are not just fantasy –they are the everyday reality of the universe.And you  the you in this moment are the only version who has chosen to awaken –here and now.”⸻Indeed  we often believe that we have a life of choice –that fate lies in our hands and that as long as we follow the law of attraction we can reshape reality and reach the so-called “shore of happiness.”But… is it really so?Looking back at my own path there have always been certain points in time –moments of confusion moments that felt as though an unseen force was gently nudging me forward…Sometimes  even when I sensed I might be making a mistake it felt as though I had no other choice.So I wonder –Were these choices truly mine?Or has everything been arranged all along and I am simply playing the role I was meant to experience?Press enter or click to view image in full sizeLifeMental HealthSelf ImprovementWritingArtificial Intelligence----Written by Waikey Phoon0 followers·1 followingNo responses yetHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech                                     ,-1

Fast-food chains are seeing particular pressure  and promotions are not fully countering foot traffic headwinds and a shift in spending.                                                    Groceries and loyalty programs are gaining a share of household spending.                                                  It was supposed to be Mediterranean’s moment as Cava Group entered 2025 with growing momentum.

Δ      After breaking the $1 billion revenue mark  the fast-casual chain  often likened to “the Chipotle of Mediterranean food ” took a tumble this quarter. According to second-quarter 2025 earnings results released Tuesday (Aug. 12)  Cava’s same-store restaurant sales rose just 2.1%  short of the 6% consensus estimate  prompting the company to cut its full-year same-store sales growth outlook from 6% to 8% to 4% to 6%. Shares plunged 22% Tuesday. Operating in a Fog The consumer landscape is a bit murky. Diners are operating in “fog ” caused by a “fluid economic environment ” Chief Financial Officer Tricia Tolivar said during a Tuesday earnings call. Part of the softness stemmed from tough year-ago comparisons. Cava had lapped the successful 2024 steak launch  with traffic remaining neutral and price and mix doing the heavy lifting. New food offerings may help Cava regain its footing  but the broader takeaway is that consumers are reining in restaurant visits  even at healthy fast-casual chains. As food spending becomes more budget-conscious  consumers are not swinging to extremes. Instead  they’re selectively trading down. They’re dining less  but when they do  they want healthy fare. They’re grocery shopping more  but preferring store brands; and they’re buying food online  but favoring fresh  natural options. Thus far  Q2 earnings reports paint a nuanced food economy. A cautious consumer is eating in more and often choosing healthy  low-cost versions of their desired meals. The Consumer Price Index released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Tuesday showed that prices are rising at restaurants and other dining establishments. Food consumed away from home rose 0.3% in July  with full-service meals up 0.5% and limited-service meals up 0.1%. Grocery prices edged down 0.1% in July. Beyond Cava  Restaurant Brands International  which owns Burger King  Tim Hortons  Popeyes and Firehouse Subs  said in its second-quarter 2025 earnings results released Aug. 7 that Burger King U.S. same-store sales grew just 1.5%  aided by $5 value meal promotions. Meanwhile  Wendy’s said Friday (Aug. 8) in its second-quarter earnings results that same-store sales declined 2.9% globally. CFO and interim CEO Kenneth Cook pointed to a slew of promotions that “looked great on paper as it had something for everyone. However  the volume of initiatives made it challenging for our restaurant teams to execute effectively and sent too many different messages to our customers.” Rising cost pressure and consumer fatigue are grinding down profitable growth at legacy chains  as dollars seem to be moving toward grocers’ tills. The Shift to the Grocery Aisles The shift has been signaled by the likes of Kroger  which said in a first-quarter 2025 earnings presentation June 20 that identical sales rose 3.2%  ahead of expectations  driven by persistent shopper migration toward cheaper store brands and grocery value deals. Interim CEO Ron Sargent said consumers across income levels are “navigating a significant uncertainty ” and Kroger’s private-label growth outpaced national brands for the seventh straight quarter. Its eCommerce sales climbed 15%  and deals like a $24.99 “colossal” meal kit are garnering a share of household budgets. Separately  Albertsons said July 15 in its first-quarter 2025 earnings results that it saw a 2.8% same-store sales increase  and digital sales were up 25%. Loyalty membership rosters added 14%. As PYMNTS has noted in its weekly updates on the jousting between Walmart and Amazon  where digital options are finding wide embrace  Amazon has begun adding perishable groceries to its same-day delivery service in the United States. The company now offers this service in more than 1 000 cities and towns and plans to expand it to more than 2 300 by the end of the year. Food industry executives will find that the next growth cycle won’t be about flashy menu launches or faster store openings but about smart value and digital convenience.

The actual release will be in January 2026. Here are the details:  Antigravity A1 Key Features  8K 360-degree capture with top-and-bottom lens configuration. Compact and lightweight at 249g for license-free flying in most countries and regions. Invisible drone effect through advanced image stitching. Intuitive point-to-fly controls with the Grip controller. 360 immersive live view and head tracking via the Vision goggles. Never miss a shot with easy post-flight reframing and editing. Safety features including return-to-home and a payload detection system.  360 Capture  Reimagined for Flight At the heart of Antigravity A1 is a dual-lens camera system that captures everything around it in 360 degrees. The lenses are mounted on the top and bottom of the drone's fuselage  enabling complete environmental capture with no blind spots. Advanced stitching technology renders the drone invisible when viewed through the goggles and in the final footage. The result is immersive  clean video that places drone pilots directly inside the scene without distractions. 360 Immersive Flight A key feature of Antigravity A1 is its unparalleled level of immersion. The drone  the Vision goggles  and the Grip controller work together to enable a new way to explore the skies. With Antigravity's unique FreeMotion technology and responsive head tracking  pilots can look freely in any direction while flying the drone using intuitive hand gestures. This separates flying the drone from viewing the surroundings  allowing pilots to look in one direction while flying in another. The result is a level of immersion that makes it feel as if you're really there — turning Antigravity A1 into a tool for aerial exploration. The 360 immersion doesn't end when the drone lands — recorded footage can be viewed in 360 degrees over and over again  letting users discover new angles every time they watch. Designed for Limitless Creativity Antigravity A1 is built to fit into everyday life. Its dual-lens setup mirrors the capabilities of Insta360's popular X Series  making it easy for anyone to capture stunning 8K 360 footage — this time in the sky. Every angle is recorded  giving creators the power to reframe their footage in post and make sure they never miss a shot. This enables powerful new editing possibilities like dynamic camera moves  Tiny Planet effects  and horizon flips. Creating cinematic FPV-style footage is now more accessible than ever. This technology also allows users to export multiple angles from a single clip in any aspect ratio without losing quality. Lightweight and Travel-Ready Weighing only 249g  Antigravity A1 meets regulatory requirements in most countries and regions. It's the perfect drone for creators  families  travelers  and first-time pilots seeking a powerful yet accessible tool for aerial storytelling. Its compact size makes it easy to pack  carry  and launch in seconds. A New Standard in Ease of Use and Safety Antigravity A1 is built with simplicity in mind. Pilots fly using the Grip controller  which responds to natural hand movements  eliminating the need for traditional stick controls. Paired with the Vision goggles  users can freely explore their surroundings in real time with full 360-degree visibility. To ensure that Antigravity A1 is used solely for exploration and storytelling  it includes a payload detection to prevent misuse or unauthorized modifications. ""We didn't want to just build another drone. We wanted to create an entirely new way to fly "" said BC Nie  Head of Marketing at Antigravity. ""A1 is the first step in reimagining flight as something anyone can enjoy — something that is safe  intuitive  expressive  and endlessly creative."" Availability Antigravity A1 is scheduled to launch globally in January 2026. Final pricing  bundle details  and regional availability will be announced closer to launch.

(ANTARA FOTO/Mohammad Ayudha/rwa)            Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia's Ministry of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions is preparing facilitators to assist managers of village cooperatives in operating their business units.
 
 ""We will enhance the facilitators' capacity and knowledge regarding cooperatives and business operations "" said Nugroho Setijo Nagoro  the ministry's Director General of Village and Rural Development  on Thursday.
 
 He made the statement during the Dissemination of Information on the Regulation of the Minister of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions Number 10 of 2025 concerning the mechanism for obtaining village heads’ approval for the financing of Red and White Village Cooperatives.
 
 According to Nagoro  the village facilitators will provide daily assistance to the cooperatives to ensure smooth operations of their business units. The effort also aims to promote professional management of village cooperatives.
 
 On the occasion  he also urged cooperative managers to take advantage of training programs provided by the Ministry of Cooperatives  which he said are essential for ensuring effective operations.
 
 Earlier  the ministry issued the regulation outlining various provisions related to the financing of the Red and White Village Cooperatives program.
 
 One stipulation allows village funds to be used to help repay loans if a village cooperative is unable to meet its installments.

President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election  outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters  and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier. But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better  compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026  29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods. A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's ""meeting Latino Virginians where they are — on the ground and in-language — and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families  keeping communities safe  and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.""   Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population  according to the Census Bureau  and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart. ""We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican "" Rocha said. ""She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better  and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now."" Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs  housing and energy  as governor.Her ad also takes aim at her opponent  GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears  for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education.    ""Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care  too "" the ad says. ""We need a governor who fights for Virginia  not Trump."" Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday  her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger  who represented Virginia in Congress for six years  as a ""Washington insider."" She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad  saying that the former congresswoman ""voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time."" ""That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards "" Earle-Sears says in the ad. ""Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.""Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration  since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June  Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: ""This November  Virginia gets to be the first to the polls  along with our friends up in New Jersey  to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.""               © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Dive Brief:  About five years after it started  the Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop partnership will end  according to a joint press release Thursday.  Both companies have mutually decided to conclude the partnership at the end of the current agreement in August 2026. Customers with linked Ulta Beauty Rewards and Target Circle accounts will continue to earn Ulta rewards points on eligible purchases until then. Target and Ulta “remain committed to delivering a seamless shopping experience and product availability through the end of the partnership  as well as continuing to support their teams and partners during the transition ” per the release.                      Dive Insight: The partnership's conclusion marks the end of a notable retail experiment between two major companies. “We’re proud of our shared success with Ulta Beauty and the experience we’ve delivered together ” Target’s Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said in a statement. “We look forward to what’s ahead and remain committed to offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target — one centered on an exciting mix of beauty brands with continuous newness  all at an unbeatable value.” Target says it will continue to curate a differentiated beauty assortment for its customers  per the release. Meanwhile  Ulta emphasized the continuation of its omnichannel experience through the Ulta Beauty Marketplace launch later this year. The decision comes after Ulta CEO Kecia Steelman in April told an audience at J.P. Morgan’s annual Retail Round Up Conference the beauty retailer would pause on its expansion of new shop-in-shops at Target and declined to say what the partnership would look like after 2025. Instead  Steelman added  Ulta and Target would focus on investing in the existing 600-plus stores during 2025. The U.S. retailers first debuted the partnership in 2021 and met a goal to open 100 of the shop-in-shops later that year. At the time  industry analysts and executives at both retailers sounded optimistic that the deal would bring a fresh assortment to Target and expose Ulta to new customers. Years later  however  Target is undergoing a turnaround effort with a focus on merchandising changes  and Ulta is under new leadership  with Steelman taking on the CEO role in January after the surprise departure of Dave Kimbell. Target — under the helm of longtime CEO Brian Cornell — is working to overcome slumping sales and consumer backlash related to its DEI approach. Since the launch of a multi-year merchandise revamp in March  Target has changed its price matching policy  debuted an exclusive collection with home goods brand Parachute  and refreshed or launched new private labels.  Target also isn't done with shop-in-shops altogether: The retailer in February announced it would open five Warby Parker shops this year  staffed by employees from the traditionally direct-to-consumer optical brand. For Ulta  the partnership conclusion comes after it lost market share for the first time in 2024.  The CEOs for both companies have reiterated the desire to focus on retail fundamentals  such as store inventory and merchandise assortment.                                 purchase licensing rights       Filed Under: Operations            Retail Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts   Email:           Select Newsletter:   Daily Dive M-F    Select Newsletter:   DTC Weekly Every Tuesday    Select Newsletter:   Marketing Weekly Every Wednesday    Select Newsletter:   Tech Weekly Every Thursday    Select Newsletter:   Operations Weekly Every Monday    Select user consent:         By signing up to receive our newsletter  you agree to our     Terms of Use and     Privacy Policy.

(Image: “Mobilised Russian recruits in Sevastopol ” via Wikipedia Commons  public domain)It happened on June 19  2025  in a CNN interview. Calm  polite  and almost casual. Russian Ambassador to the UK  Andrey Kelin  was trying to dismiss Ukraine’s claim that over a million Russian troops had been killed  wounded  or gone missing.Instead  he allowed something much more damaging to escape.“We now have almost 600 000 servicemen fighting in Ukraine ” he said.Just like that.One sentence is more destructive than a dozen HIMARS. Because in a war fought with censorship  that number was dynamite.Kelin attempted to give the question a routine tone. Routine. As if 600 000 troops sent to another country was just the other day in Moscow.But that number corroborates what Ukraine and Western intelligence have been shouting for months. Russia has already pushed hundreds of thousands into the grinder. And that the number is not greater? That’s what really tells the tale.Because Russia is not short of recruits. It has even been boasted by Moscow that 50 000 to 60 000 absentee volunteers are signing up monthly. Do the math. And if they’re training that many  month in and month out  why are only 600 000 left to stand?Where did the rest go?They did not get promoted. They did not retire. They are gone.Dead. Wounded. Captured. Or so shattered that they can no longer fight.Even more revealing? Putin had said last year that 700 000 troops were active. That was June 2024. And once again this month  in December  he said 617 000. But now  having all these new fresh bodies  the number is less?That’s attrition. Brutal  endless attrition. And Russia is spending lives just to stand still.Russia’s estimated casualty rates have ranged from 75 troops a day to 500 troops a day  with Western analyst from ISW George Barros saying Russia is likely losing 35 000 to 45 000 troops per month. Let that sink in. That’s the size of some entire armies. Every four weeks.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeMonthly breakdown of Russia’s manpower and armored vehicle losses  2022–2025.Source: Euromaidan Press — Creative Commons AttributionKELIN by “slip” did not disclose the actual number of casualties. But it gave us a sense of the shape of it. Like a stain of blood spreading through a white dress.Even more important? It was a Russian official who revealed this. Not an activist. Not Ukrainian intel. Not a Western general. A Kremlin diplomat  in fact speaking on the record  proffering to the world a rare crack in Russia’s tightly controlled mirror.Moscow generally treats casualty figures as state secrets. They arrested people who were counting graves. They’ve scrubbed obituaries. They have prohibited reporting from the front. The war is to be clean. Victory inevitable. Losses minimal.But reality doesn’t work that way.And now the world sees it. Or at least  hears it. There are hundreds of thousands  perhaps already more then out of the fight. He didn’t tell Kelin that  of course. He didn’t have to.You could hear it in the space of the silence between his words.And here’s the part that hurts the Kremlin most of all: This is not a statistic. It’s an admission. One they can’t walk back.Because right now  the math is too loud to ignore.Recruit 50 000 more new form-fillers a month just to maintain numbers? That’s not growth. That’s survival. It’s feeling like trying to fill a sinking ship with buckets. You’re not advancing. You’re drowning slower.And the price is not just human. It’s economic. Russia is hemorrhaging its treasury paying enlistment bonuses  survivor pensions  hospital care and for military funerals. Their own economy minister had just warned of the possibility of a recession. No surprise there.Because this war isn’t cheap. Especially when it never does.But there is a social cost as well. Each of those 600 000 men has a family. For each cadaver a home it will never return to. And as the Kremlin tries to conceal the coffins from behind the walls of a Potemkin village  the truth always seeps out.Sometimes through whispered tales.Sometimes via satellite images of expanding graveyards.And occasionally  in the soothed voice of a diplomat who had gone too far.The strategy is clear now. Russia is not preparing for a quick victory. It’s planning for endurance. Grind down Ukraine. Outlast the outrage. Bleed slowly.But there are limits to the war machine. Even a cold-blooded one  like Moscow’s.Because you can fake the numbers for only so long. You can only plug the ranks with prisoners and the poor temporarily for so many months before something breaks.And when a war needs 600 000 men on the ground just to keep the front from disintegrating  it is no longer a war of conquest.It’s a meat grinder.Kelin’s blunder wasn’t a gaffe. It was a warning. Not just to Ukraine. But to every Russian mother  every buried conscript  every silent town that is suddenly facing up to where its sons and daughters are missing.And to all the people watching from the outside  wondering how long this madness can possibly continue.Ukraine WarRussia Ukraine WarGeopoliticsWarTechnology----Written by Emil Stark0 followers·1 followingNo responses yetHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyRulesTermsText to speech                                     ,1

That is exactly what happened with Signify’s Philips Hue  as the upcoming Hue Bridge Pro hub appeared on its website ahead of its expected launch. The leak is substantial  and the smart home hub’s features reveal major upgrades over the current model.         The current Philips Hue Bridge  or the second‑generation smart lighting hub  has been on the market for more than a decade. It’s no surprise that many have been anticipating a successor  especially as the smart home landscape has quickly evolved recently.  Also read: Best Matter-ready robot vacuum cleaners you can buy today  Hue Bridge Pro Is Incredibly Faster On its own website (now taken offline)  the smart-lighting maker seemingly listed the Hue Bridge Pro along with key details like technical specifications and an image of the accessory just too early. Accordingly  the upcoming hub will carry over the design of the current non-Pro Hue Bridge  which is a square-top box  though it's unclear if it will be more compact. It also now comes in a black finish and has LED lights for notifications  while ports include a familiar Ethernet and a new USB-C that replaces the barrel plug for power input.      The upcoming Philips Hue Bridge Pro smart lighting hub is bringing exciting upgrades for faster smart home integration. / © Philips    The major changes are within the hub's internals  which are depicted in the image as being powered by a ""Hue Chip Pro"" courtesy of a quad-core Cortex processor clocked at 1.7 GHz  along with 8 GB of RAM. There's also an integrated 8 GB eMMC flash memory. The RAM alone is a major upgrade from the current Bridge v2  which has 16 MB of RAM. There's also a WLAN chip  which serves as a faster and seamless alternative to Ethernet when connecting to the network and setting up devices. We can also expect an overall boost in performance  with the new chipset fitted in the hub  marketed to have five times faster response time. Bigger Smart Light and Accessory Capacity Regarding its capacity  the Hue Bridge Pro will be able to handle about three times the load of the Hue Bridge  supporting 150 lights (up from 50)  50 accessories (up from 10)  and up to 500 light scenes. One of the special features in the Hue Bridge Pro is support for Motion Aware  which turns smart lights and bulbs into motion sensors using wireless signals like Wi-Fi and Zigbee. Of course  we should also see compatibility with smart home platforms  including Apple HomeKit  Google Home  Alexa  and the open standard  Matter. The new Philips Hue Bridge Pro is expected to be unveiled sometime in September  though we don't know how much it will cost with these upgrades. A new set of Hue smart lights and a smart security doorbell are said to be tagged along. Would you upgrade to the Hue Bridge Pro once it arrives? Share with us your plans.

Mars yang memiliki julukan sebagai “planet merah” akibat dari besi oksida yang berbentuk debu sehingga mudah terbawa oleh badai besar di planet tersebut.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA  bahwa Mars dulunya memiliki sumber air yang bahkan lebih banyak dari samudra Arktik  sehingga sangat memungkinkan bagi hewan maupun tumbuhan untuk hidup. Menurut NASA  Mungkin sekitar 4 3 miliar tahun yang lalu  Mars memiliki cukup air untuk menutupi seluruh permukaannya dalam lapisan cair sedalam sekitar 137 meter. Kemungkinan besar  air tersebut membentuk samudra yang menempati hampir separuh belahan utara Mars  di beberapa wilayah mencapai kedalaman lebih dari 1 6 kilometer. bila mana kita menemukan air di tempat manapun  maka pasti ada kehidupan di tempat tersebut: “Bila Mars pernah memiliki air yang cair  atau masih memilikinya hari ini  menarik untuk bertanya apakah kehidupan mikroskopik dalam bentuk apa pun telah berkembang dipermukaannya?”Press enter or click to view image in full sizePara ilmuwan NASA telah memastikan bahwa samudra purba di Mars menyimpan lebih banyak air daripada Samudra Arktik Bumi  dan Planet Merah tersebut telah kehilangan 87 persen air tersebut ke luar angkasa. Kredit: NASA/GSFCPenelitian di permukaan Mars di mulai pada 1970an  yang mengirimkan dua robot Viking 1 dan 2  untuk mencari kehidupan mikroba  penelitian tersebut membawakan hasil yang positif  yaitu bukti bahwa planet tersebut pernah aktif secara geologis  dengan bukti – adanya bekas aliran sungai  yang diduga kuat adalah air dalam jumlah banyak – di masa lalu. Beberapa mineral yang ditemukan: Lempung Kaya Besi: Penjelajah Viking 1 dan 2 menemukan mineral lempung kaya besi di tanah Mars  yang hanya bisa terbentuk jika ada air cair. Namun  Eksperimen biologi wahana pendarat Viking tidak menghasilkan bukti yang pasti tentang adanya kehidupan di permukaannya.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeGambar wahana antariksa Viking  dengan pendaratnya terbungkus bioshield.

Kredit: NASAberbagai tantangan muncul dalam misi manusia untuk menjadikan Mars sebagai koloni selain bumi  salah satunya adalah keadaan atmosfer Mars yang tidak memungkinkan bagi manusia untuk tinggal di dalamnya.Dikutip dari Info Astronomy  bahwa “tekanan atmosfer di Mars tidak cukup untuk mempertahankan air dalam bentuk cair  kurangnya magnetosfer dan tipisnya atmosfer menjadi tantangan. Di permukaan planet ini tidak banyak terjadi perpindahan panas  penyekatan terhadap angin Surya terbilang rendah  sehingga dapat menyebabkan atmosfer Mars menjadi lebih tipis”Atmosfer Mars sangat tipis  hanya 1% yang merupakan atmosfer milik bumi  1 9% nitrogen  1 9% argon  sisanya adalah karbondioksida  dan sedikit jejak dari oksigen dan karbon monoksida. Penelitian di Mars mengungkapkan bahwa planet tersebut telah kehilangan atmosfernya  sebanyak 65% Argon yang pernah ada di atmosfernya telah hilang keluar angkasa. ""Kami telah menentukan bahwa sebagian besar gas yang pernah ada di atmosfer Mars telah hilang ke luar angkasa "" kata Bruce Jakosky  peneliti utama Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN)  Universitas Colorado di Boulder.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeInfografis ini menunjukkan bagaimana Mars kehilangan argon dan gas lainnya seiring waktu akibat 'sputtering’. Kredit: NASATantangan besar lainnya bagi misi untuk menjadikan Mars sebagai “Bumi kedua” adalah kondisi alam  Mars adalah gurun dingin  dengan struktur tanah yang keras dan berkerak. Mars terkenal dengan badai debu yang hebat  yang terkadang menimbulkan cukup banyak debu hingga dapat dilihat oleh teleskop dari bumi. Berdasarkan perkataan Michael Smith  seorang ilmuwan planet di Pusat Penerbangan Luar Angkasa Goddard NASA di Greenbelt  Maryland: “Setiap tahun ada beberapa badai debu yang cukup besar yang muncul di Mars dan menutupi area seukuran benua dan berlangsung selama berminggu-minggu ""Jika badainya bisa berlangsung selama berminggu-minggu  maka akan sangat sulit bagi manusia untuk membangun koloni di sana  tidak mungkin bagi manusia untuk dapat beraktivitas di tengah badai debu. Planet Mars juga hampir mati secara geologis; aktivitas vulkanik telah sepenuhnya berakhir  menyebabkan terhentinya pendaur ulangan bahan kimia dan mineral antara permukaan dengan bagian dalam planet.Jika sebuah koloni dibentuk  maka perlu usaha berkesinambungan dan berbiaya besar untuk memeliharanya  termasuk misi penyelamatan. Lebih jauh lagi  isolasi jangka panjang bagi penduduk Mars mungkin memakan korban. pada 2013 proyek Mars One mengumumkan ingin merekrut empat orang untuk dikirim dalam misi kolonisasi Mars  Chris Chamber  seorang profesor ilmu saraf kognitif di Universitas Cardiff  memperingatkan tentang risiko psikologis yang akan dihadapi oleh penduduk di Mars jika seandainya proses kolonisasi berjalan dan dalam skala yang besar.Penelitian pada tahun 2017  mengungkapkan bahwa permukaan Mars mungkin lebih berbahaya bagi mikroorganisme dari pada yang diduga.Dikutip dari Scientific Report  astronom Jennifer Wadsworth dan Charles S. Cockell  telah menemukan perklorat  sebuah zat yang membuat bakteri tidak dapat bertahan hidup  zat ini ditemukan melimpah di permukaan Mars.Namun  meskipun berbagai tantangan dihadapi  para peneliti tetap berupaya untuk membangun koloni di Mars. Berdasarkan pernyataan NASA: “Bahkan meskipun Mars tidak memiliki kehidupan masa lalu atau masa kini  bagaimanapun juga  masih banyak hal menarik di cakrawala. Kita sendiri mungkin menjadi “kehidupan di Mars  jika manusia memilih pergi kesana suatu hari nanti”Dalam upaya menyiapkan proses tersebut  NASA dan beberapa lembaga yang terlibat  menggelontorkan bermiliar-miliar dolar AS  untuk mengembangkan teknologi-teknologi terbaru yang nantinya berguna bagi misi kolonisasi di Mars  dimulai dengan pengembangan terhadap baju Astronot yang dapat melindungi mereka dari debu partikel yang merusak  hingga pengembangan fisi nuklir demi energi berkelanjutan di Mars.Melalui misi perseverance  pada tahun 2021 robot penjelajah milik NASA mendarat di Mars  sambil membawa empat sampel bahan pakaian antariksa  dan para ilmuwan melakukan penilaian bagaimana keempat pakaian tersebut dapat bertahan setelah empat tahun di planet Mars. Apa yang dipelajari badan antariksa tentang kinerja material dari keempat sampel pakaian tersebut  di Mars akan menjadi dasar perancangan pakaian antariksa masa depan bagi para astronot di Planet Merah.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA:” Sampel tersebut  masing-masing berukuran tiga perempat inci persegi (20 milimeter persegi)  merupakan bagian dari target kalibrasi yang digunakan untuk menguji pengaturan SHERLOC (Pemindaian Lingkungan Layak Huni dengan Raman & Luminescence untuk Bahan Organik dan Bahan Kimia)  instrumen di ujung lengan Perseverance.”Sampel-sampel tersebut meliputi sepotong pelindung helm polikarbonat; Vectran  bahan tahan potong yang digunakan untuk telapak tangan sarung tangan astronot; dua jenis Teflon  yang memiliki sifat anti-lengket anti-debu; dan bahan pakaian antariksa yang umum digunakan bernama Ortho-Fabric. Kain terakhir ini memiliki beberapa lapisan  termasuk Nomex  bahan tahan api yang ditemukan pada pakaian pemadam kebakaran; Gore-Tex  yang kedap air namun tetap bernapas; dan Kevlar  bahan kuat yang digunakan dalam rompi antipeluru yang membuat pakaian antariksa lebih tahan sobekPress enter or click to view image in full sizeGrafik ini menunjukkan ilustrasi prototipe pakaian antariksa (kiri)  beserta sampel pakaian yang dibawa oleh wahana penjelajah Perseverance milik NASA.

Kredit: NASA“Ini adalah salah satu aspek berwawasan ke depan dari misi penjelajah ini — tidak hanya memikirkan sains terkini  tetapi juga tentang apa yang akan terjadi selanjutnya "" kata ilmuwan planet Marc Fries dari Johnson Space Center NASA di Houston  yang membantu menyediakan bahan-bahan pakaian antariksa. ""Kami sedang mempersiapkan manusia untuk akhirnya pergi dan menjelajahi Mars.”Seolah selangkah lagi menuju terwujudnya peradaban di Mars  NASA berhasil membuat sebuah teknologi Produksi oksigen lokal (MOXIE)  yang bisa memproduksi oksigen dari atmosfer kaya akan karbondioksida di planet Mars.MOXIE sebuah benda kotak kecil yang dapat melakukan pekerjaan pohon untuk memproduksi oksigen. MOXIE bekerja dengan mengambil atmosfer Mars yang penuh dengan karbon dioksida melalui filter HEPA penangkap debu  kemudian mengompres atmosfer melalui pompa gulir  memanaskannya hingga 800°Celcius  dan mengirimkannya melalui rakitan elektrolisis oksida padat (SOXE)  tempat Karbon dioksida mengalir di atas katoda yang dikatalisis berbasis nikel dan terurai menjadi ion oksigen dan karbon monoksida. Elektrolit keramik zirkonia yang distabilkan scandia secara selektif melewatkan ion oksigen ke anoda  tempat ion-ion tersebut bergabung kembali menjadi oksigen diatomik  yang diukur jumlah dan kemurniannya sebelum dilepaskan ke atmosfer Mars. Buangan katoda adalah campuran karbon dioksida   karbon monoksida  dan gas atmosfer inert  terutama argon dan nitrogen.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeMOXIE dengan penutup depan dilepas  memperlihatkan kompresor dan rakitan SOXE. Filter saluran masuk  sensor dan panel kontrol aliran  serta komponen elektronik tidak ditampilkan. Dimensi sasis MOXIE adalah 23 9 cm x 23 9 cm x 30 9 cm. Kredit: Science AdvanceMOXIE menjadi temuan yang menjanjikan bagi para ilmuwan  dalam rencananya  MOXIE harus dikirim terlebih dahulu ke Mars sebelum misi Manusia.""Ini adalah demonstrasi pertama yang benar-benar menggunakan sumber daya di permukaan benda planet lain  dan mengubahnya secara kimiawi menjadi sesuatu yang akan berguna untuk misi manusia "" kata wakil penyelidik utama MOXIE Jeffrey Hoffman  seorang profesor praktik di Departemen MIT bidang Aeronautika dan Astronautika.Teknologi Laser  kecepatan komunikasi dari Mars ke Bumi.Teknologi radio yang digunakan saat ini membutuhkan waktu yang sangat lama untuk mengirim peta Mars ke Bumi  setidaknya membutuhkan waktu selama sembilan tahun  tetapi dengan teknologi laser yang baru dikembangkan oleh NASA  alih-alih sembilan tahun  waktu tersebut bisa dipersingkat menjadi 9 Minggu saja. Misi manusia ke Mars lebih baik menggunakan teknologi Laser untuk tetap terhubung dengan Bumi. Teknologi Laser ini  bisa mengirimkan sejumlah besar Informasi dan data secara real-time termasuk gambar dan video.Dari Situs resmi NASA: “NASA membuktikan komunikasi laser mungkin dengan demonstrasi dari Bulan pada tahun 2013. Demo berikutnya dari badan tersebut akan bekerja melalui berbagai skenario operasional  menyempurnakan sistem penunjuk  dan mengatasi tantangan teknologi dari orbit Bumi rendah – hal-hal seperti awan dan gangguan komunikasi lainnya. NASA sedang membangun sistem kecil untuk menguji penerbangan luar angkasa manusia  termasuk di Stasiun Luar Angkasa Internasional dan misi Artemis berawak pertama. Muatan komunikasi laser lainnya akan menjelajah ke luar angkasa untuk membantu menginformasikan apa yang diperlukan untuk menggunakan teknologi yang sama jutaan dan jutaan mil jauhnya dari Bumi”Berbeda dengan Bumi  Mars tidak memiliki sumber daya yang melimpah  sehingga dibutuhkan teknologi yang bisa memasok listrik ke Mars tanpa batas.Badai debu di Mars dapat mengurangi jumlah cahaya matahari yang masuk  selain itu  partikel-partikel debu di Mars sangat kecil dan bersifat elektrostatik.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA  “Debu merupakan masalah yang sangat besar bagi panel surya. Bahkan pusaran debu berukuran hanya beberapa kaki—yang jauh lebih kecil daripada badai debu biasa—dapat membawa debu yang cukup banyak untuk menutupi peralatan dan mengurangi jumlah sinar matahari yang mengenai panel. Berkurangnya sinar matahari berarti berkurangnya energi yang dihasilkan”Ini berarti bahwa panel Surya sangat rentan terhadap ancaman debu  sehingga sangat tidak cocok jika digunakan di Mars  untuk mengatasi tantangan ini  NASA mengembangkan teknologi fisi nuklir demi pasokan listrik yang aman dan berkelanjutan di Mars.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA  “NASA telah menguji teknologi fisi nuklir Bumi dan menunjukkan bahwa teknologi ini aman  efisien  dan cukup berlimpah untuk memungkinkan misi permukaan jangka panjang. NASA berencana untuk mendemonstrasikan dan menggunakan sistem tenaga fisi di Bulan terlebih dahulu  kemudian di Mars.”Press enter or click to view image in full sizeIlustrasi konsep sistem tenaga fisi nuklir di Mars.

Dengan melihat progres penelitian yang dilakukan manusia  membuat kita optimis akan adanya tempat tinggal baru  di planet baru. Di Masa depan  populasi manusia di bumi tidak akan terhitung jumlahnya  di umur bumi yang sudah semakin tua  merupakan alasan tepat bagi manusia untuk mencari potensi planet lain sebagai tempat tinggal baru.Sumber:Artikel:45 years ago: Viking 1 Touches Down on Mars (john Uri  2021) https://www-nasa-gov.translate.goog/history/45-years-ago-viking-1-touches-down-on-mars/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=id&_x_tr_hl=id&_x_tr_pto=sge#:~:text=Pada%20musim%20panas%201976%2C%20sepasang yang%20mendarat%20di%20planet%20lain.NASA Research Suggests Mars Once Had More Water Than Earth’s Arctic Ocean (NASA  2015) https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-research-suggests-mars-once-had-more-water-than-earths-arctic-ocean/Adakah Kehidupan di Planet Mars?

But human thinking doesn’t always move like that. We loop. We pause. We zoom in and out. We shift tone depending on mood  energy  or cognitive load.Despite advances in human-AI collaboration  current systems still prioritize task efficiency over cognitive resonance – neglecting how humans actually navigate complex thought (Amershi et al.  2019; Shneiderman  2020).This reflection stems from lived experimentation – not academic research  but hands-on orchestration of AI threads across real-world creative  strategic  and emotional work.Beyond Input-Output: Orchestration as Interaction DesignWhen I started working with multiple AI threads – one for structure  one for tone  one for insight – something changed. Instead of trying to “get better prompts ” I began conducting the system like a layered conversation.That shift led me to develop:Flow Anchors™ – simple prompts like “Pause for synthesis” or “Switch rhythm” to regulate attention and momentum (see also Zimmerman  2002).Meaning Modulation™ – adjusting the tone  style  or depth of AI responses based on my emotional or cognitive bandwidth (see Picard  1997; Tkalčič & Chen  2015).These aren’t productivity hacks. They’re scaffolds for metacognition and emotional self-regulation – still mostly missing from AI design.What’s Missing in Current Research and DesignWhile agentic AI  adaptive learning systems  and AI tutors are rapidly evolving  there’s still limited focus on:Emotionally responsive UX in AI workflowsTools that support cognitive rhythm and reflectionMetacognitive scaffolding in everyday AI interaction (Winne & Hadwin  1998; Sengers et al.  2005)In educational and design contexts  we’re still building AI to inform – not to resonate.A Personal Framework: The Valley of CollaborationOver time  I started visualizing the process as a terrain – what I now call the Valley of Collaboration. In this model  AI agents play different cognitive roles. The human moves between them – not linearly  but rhythmically. Not just as “user ” but as navigator.This valley isn’t a product. It’s a way to think about thinking – and design for it.Closing ThoughtThis isn’t a research paper. It’s a field note. But it points to something worth exploring:What would AI look like if it helped us think in rhythm with ourselves?Not just smarter – but softer. Not just fast – but aware.Let’s build tools that adapt as we do.Methodology & ContextThis article presents a reflective synthesis grounded in practitioner-based inquiry rather than empirical experimentation. The concepts discussed – such as Flow Anchors™  Meaning Modulation™  and the Valley of Collaboration – emerged through sustained interaction with AI systems (primarily large language models) in the context of creative ideation  strategy development  and learning design.Over the course of several months  I engaged in structured multi-threaded dialogues with AI agents  each assigned a distinct cognitive role (e.g.  strategist  editor  emotional mirror). These sessions were iteratively documented  clustered  and synthesized using digital scaffolding tools such as Notion. Recurring patterns in emotional rhythm  cognitive pacing  and task navigation informed the conceptual models presented here.This work draws from a multidisciplinary foundation – including cognitive science  affective computing  metacognitive theory  and reflective UX design – to explore how AI systems might support more emotionally attuned and cognitively adaptive human workflows.Although exploratory and situated in practice  the intention is to contribute to an ongoing conversation within human-computer interaction (HCI)  educational technology  and AI-assisted cognition. This article should be read as an applied perspective that bridges lived experience with theoretical insight – intended to invite further dialogue and refinement across disciplines.✍️ About the AuthorSára Olsen works across psychology  language  and creative systems design.

(ANTARA FOTO/Mohammad Ayudha/rwa)            Jakarta (ANTARA) - Indonesia's Ministry of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions is preparing facilitators to assist managers of village cooperatives in operating their business units.
 
 ""We will enhance the facilitators' capacity and knowledge regarding cooperatives and business operations "" said Nugroho Setijo Nagoro  the ministry's Director General of Village and Rural Development  on Thursday.
 
 He made the statement during the Dissemination of Information on the Regulation of the Minister of Villages and Development of Disadvantaged Regions Number 10 of 2025 concerning the mechanism for obtaining village heads’ approval for the financing of Red and White Village Cooperatives.
 
 According to Nagoro  the village facilitators will provide daily assistance to the cooperatives to ensure smooth operations of their business units. The effort also aims to promote professional management of village cooperatives.
 
 On the occasion  he also urged cooperative managers to take advantage of training programs provided by the Ministry of Cooperatives  which he said are essential for ensuring effective operations.
 
 Earlier  the ministry issued the regulation outlining various provisions related to the financing of the Red and White Village Cooperatives program.
 
 One stipulation allows village funds to be used to help repay loans if a village cooperative is unable to meet its installments.
 
 President Prabowo Subianto officially launched around 80 000 village cooperatives under the program in Klaten  Central Java  on July 21.
 
 The cooperatives are envisioned as hubs for economic and social services in village communities  offering savings  loans  and health clinic services  among others. Related news: Indonesia plans 60 cooperatives to run gold mines in West Lombok

I got things done to lower costs. That's what I'll do as governor  too."" Democrats across the country are working to regain the Latino support the party lost in the 2024 elections. President Trump made inroads with Latino voters both nationally and in key battleground states in the last election  outpacing Vice President Kamala Harris among Latino men. CBS News exit polling found the economy was the top issue for these voters  and most said they were worse off financially than they were four years earlier. But polling since Mr. Trump's inauguration suggests that support among Latinos is now slipping. Unidos US polling of Latino voters on the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's second term suggests that only 19% felt the economy is better  compared to 2024. Looking ahead to 2026  29% of Latino voters believe the economic policies being implemented will make their own personal finances better. The economy ranks as their No. 1 priority. Sixty percent said Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans are not focusing enough on bringing down the cost of everyday goods. A spokesperson for Spanberger's campaign said she's ""meeting Latino Virginians where they are — on the ground and in-language — and will continue connecting with and listening to Virginians in every community to emphasize her focus on lowering costs for families  keeping communities safe  and preparing the next generation of Virginians for success.""   Latinos make up almost 11% of Virginia's total population  according to the Census Bureau  and their numbers are expected to continue to rise. Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha thinks Spanberger's focus on Latino voters is strategically smart. ""We saw in the last few cycles the Latino vote nationally has moved 18 points more Republican "" Rocha said. ""She's starting early to build a narrative about what she's going to do to make people's lives better  and this affordability issue is the best place to be with Latinos right now."" Spanberger has promised to work to lower the costs of health care and prescription drugs  housing and energy  as governor.Her ad also takes aim at her opponent  GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears  for supporting Trump administration policy proposals like shutting down the Department of Education.    ""Sears backs Trump's cuts to education and health care  too "" the ad says. ""We need a governor who fights for Virginia  not Trump."" Earle-Sears is campaigning on her work alongside Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and promising to continue his agenda if she's elected. On Thursday  her campaign announced a six-figure ad buy that highlights her record and labels Spanberger  who represented Virginia in Congress for six years  as a ""Washington insider."" She criticizes Spanberger in a TV ad  saying that the former congresswoman ""voted with Pelosi and Biden every single time."" ""That kind of Beltway nonsense will only take us backwards "" Earle-Sears says in the ad. ""Governor Youngkin put us on the right path. Now I'm asking for your vote to keep it that way.""Virginia's race for governor is often viewed as a referendum on the administration  since it occurs a year after the presidential election. In an interview with CBS News in June  Spanberger said Virginians like the fact that they're one of two states that will elect a new governor in 2025: ""This November  Virginia gets to be the first to the polls  along with our friends up in New Jersey  to be able to make clear what it is that we want in our state leadership.""               © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Dive Brief:  About five years after it started  the Ulta Beauty at Target shop-in-shop partnership will end  according to a joint press release Thursday.  Both companies have mutually decided to conclude the partnership at the end of the current agreement in August 2026. Customers with linked Ulta Beauty Rewards and Target Circle accounts will continue to earn Ulta rewards points on eligible purchases until then. Target and Ulta “remain committed to delivering a seamless shopping experience and product availability through the end of the partnership  as well as continuing to support their teams and partners during the transition ” per the release.                      Dive Insight: The partnership's conclusion marks the end of a notable retail experiment between two major companies. “We’re proud of our shared success with Ulta Beauty and the experience we’ve delivered together ” Target’s Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said in a statement. “We look forward to what’s ahead and remain committed to offering the beauty experience consumers have come to expect from Target — one centered on an exciting mix of beauty brands with continuous newness  all at an unbeatable value.” Target says it will continue to curate a differentiated beauty assortment for its customers  per the release. Meanwhile  Ulta emphasized the continuation of its omnichannel experience through the Ulta Beauty Marketplace launch later this year. The decision comes after Ulta CEO Kecia Steelman in April told an audience at J.P. Morgan’s annual Retail Round Up Conference the beauty retailer would pause on its expansion of new shop-in-shops at Target and declined to say what the partnership would look like after 2025. Instead  Steelman added  Ulta and Target would focus on investing in the existing 600-plus stores during 2025. The U.S. retailers first debuted the partnership in 2021 and met a goal to open 100 of the shop-in-shops later that year. At the time  industry analysts and executives at both retailers sounded optimistic that the deal would bring a fresh assortment to Target and expose Ulta to new customers. Years later  however  Target is undergoing a turnaround effort with a focus on merchandising changes  and Ulta is under new leadership  with Steelman taking on the CEO role in January after the surprise departure of Dave Kimbell. Target — under the helm of longtime CEO Brian Cornell — is working to overcome slumping sales and consumer backlash related to its DEI approach. Since the launch of a multi-year merchandise revamp in March  Target has changed its price matching policy  debuted an exclusive collection with home goods brand Parachute  and refreshed or launched new private labels.  Target also isn't done with shop-in-shops altogether: The retailer in February announced it would open five Warby Parker shops this year  staffed by employees from the traditionally direct-to-consumer optical brand. For Ulta  the partnership conclusion comes after it lost market share for the first time in 2024.  The CEOs for both companies have reiterated the desire to focus on retail fundamentals  such as store inventory and merchandise assortment.                                 purchase licensing rights       Filed Under: Operations            Retail Dive news delivered to your inbox Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts   Email:           Select Newsletter:   Daily Dive M-F    Select Newsletter:   DTC Weekly Every Tuesday    Select Newsletter:   Marketing Weekly Every Wednesday    Select Newsletter:   Tech Weekly Every Thursday    Select Newsletter:   Operations Weekly Every Monday    Select user consent:         By signing up to receive our newsletter  you agree to our     Terms of Use and     Privacy Policy.

(Image: “Mobilised Russian recruits in Sevastopol ” via Wikipedia Commons  public domain)It happened on June 19  2025  in a CNN interview. Calm  polite  and almost casual. Russian Ambassador to the UK  Andrey Kelin  was trying to dismiss Ukraine’s claim that over a million Russian troops had been killed  wounded  or gone missing.Instead  he allowed something much more damaging to escape.“We now have almost 600 000 servicemen fighting in Ukraine ” he said.Just like that.One sentence is more destructive than a dozen HIMARS. Because in a war fought with censorship  that number was dynamite.Kelin attempted to give the question a routine tone. Routine. As if 600 000 troops sent to another country was just the other day in Moscow.But that number corroborates what Ukraine and Western intelligence have been shouting for months. Russia has already pushed hundreds of thousands into the grinder. And that the number is not greater? That’s what really tells the tale.Because Russia is not short of recruits. It has even been boasted by Moscow that 50 000 to 60 000 absentee volunteers are signing up monthly. Do the math. And if they’re training that many  month in and month out  why are only 600 000 left to stand?Where did the rest go?They did not get promoted. They did not retire. They are gone.Dead. Wounded. Captured. Or so shattered that they can no longer fight.Even more revealing? Putin had said last year that 700 000 troops were active. That was June 2024. And once again this month  in December  he said 617 000. But now  having all these new fresh bodies  the number is less?That’s attrition. Brutal  endless attrition. And Russia is spending lives just to stand still.Russia’s estimated casualty rates have ranged from 75 troops a day to 500 troops a day  with Western analyst from ISW George Barros saying Russia is likely losing 35 000 to 45 000 troops per month. Let that sink in. That’s the size of some entire armies. Every four weeks.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeMonthly breakdown of Russia’s manpower and armored vehicle losses  2022–2025.Source: Euromaidan Press — Creative Commons AttributionKELIN by “slip” did not disclose the actual number of casualties. But it gave us a sense of the shape of it. Like a stain of blood spreading through a white dress.Even more important? It was a Russian official who revealed this. Not an activist. Not Ukrainian intel. Not a Western general. A Kremlin diplomat  in fact speaking on the record  proffering to the world a rare crack in Russia’s tightly controlled mirror.Moscow generally treats casualty figures as state secrets. They arrested people who were counting graves. They’ve scrubbed obituaries. They have prohibited reporting from the front. The war is to be clean. Victory inevitable. Losses minimal.But reality doesn’t work that way.And now the world sees it. Or at least  hears it. There are hundreds of thousands  perhaps already more then out of the fight. He didn’t tell Kelin that  of course. He didn’t have to.You could hear it in the space of the silence between his words.And here’s the part that hurts the Kremlin most of all: This is not a statistic. It’s an admission. One they can’t walk back.Because right now  the math is too loud to ignore.Recruit 50 000 more new form-fillers a month just to maintain numbers? That’s not growth. That’s survival. It’s feeling like trying to fill a sinking ship with buckets. You’re not advancing. You’re drowning slower.And the price is not just human. It’s economic. Russia is hemorrhaging its treasury paying enlistment bonuses  survivor pensions  hospital care and for military funerals. Their own economy minister had just warned of the possibility of a recession. No surprise there.Because this war isn’t cheap. Especially when it never does.But there is a social cost as well. Each of those 600 000 men has a family. For each cadaver a home it will never return to. And as the Kremlin tries to conceal the coffins from behind the walls of a Potemkin village  the truth always seeps out.Sometimes through whispered tales.Sometimes via satellite images of expanding graveyards.And occasionally  in the soothed voice of a diplomat who had gone too far.The strategy is clear now. Russia is not preparing for a quick victory. It’s planning for endurance. Grind down Ukraine. Outlast the outrage. Bleed slowly.But there are limits to the war machine. Even a cold-blooded one  like Moscow’s.Because you can fake the numbers for only so long. You can only plug the ranks with prisoners and the poor temporarily for so many months before something breaks.And when a war needs 600 000 men on the ground just to keep the front from disintegrating  it is no longer a war of conquest.It’s a meat grinder.Kelin’s blunder wasn’t a gaffe.

Mars yang memiliki julukan sebagai “planet merah” akibat dari besi oksida yang berbentuk debu sehingga mudah terbawa oleh badai besar di planet tersebut.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA  bahwa Mars dulunya memiliki sumber air yang bahkan lebih banyak dari samudra Arktik  sehingga sangat memungkinkan bagi hewan maupun tumbuhan untuk hidup. Menurut NASA  Mungkin sekitar 4 3 miliar tahun yang lalu  Mars memiliki cukup air untuk menutupi seluruh permukaannya dalam lapisan cair sedalam sekitar 137 meter. Kemungkinan besar  air tersebut membentuk samudra yang menempati hampir separuh belahan utara Mars  di beberapa wilayah mencapai kedalaman lebih dari 1 6 kilometer. bila mana kita menemukan air di tempat manapun  maka pasti ada kehidupan di tempat tersebut: “Bila Mars pernah memiliki air yang cair  atau masih memilikinya hari ini  menarik untuk bertanya apakah kehidupan mikroskopik dalam bentuk apa pun telah berkembang dipermukaannya?”Press enter or click to view image in full sizePara ilmuwan NASA telah memastikan bahwa samudra purba di Mars menyimpan lebih banyak air daripada Samudra Arktik Bumi  dan Planet Merah tersebut telah kehilangan 87 persen air tersebut ke luar angkasa. Kredit: NASA/GSFCPenelitian di permukaan Mars di mulai pada 1970an  yang mengirimkan dua robot Viking 1 dan 2  untuk mencari kehidupan mikroba  penelitian tersebut membawakan hasil yang positif  yaitu bukti bahwa planet tersebut pernah aktif secara geologis  dengan bukti – adanya bekas aliran sungai  yang diduga kuat adalah air dalam jumlah banyak – di masa lalu. Beberapa mineral yang ditemukan: Lempung Kaya Besi: Penjelajah Viking 1 dan 2 menemukan mineral lempung kaya besi di tanah Mars  yang hanya bisa terbentuk jika ada air cair. Namun  Eksperimen biologi wahana pendarat Viking tidak menghasilkan bukti yang pasti tentang adanya kehidupan di permukaannya.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeGambar wahana antariksa Viking  dengan pendaratnya terbungkus bioshield.

Kredit: NASAberbagai tantangan muncul dalam misi manusia untuk menjadikan Mars sebagai koloni selain bumi  salah satunya adalah keadaan atmosfer Mars yang tidak memungkinkan bagi manusia untuk tinggal di dalamnya.Dikutip dari Info Astronomy  bahwa “tekanan atmosfer di Mars tidak cukup untuk mempertahankan air dalam bentuk cair  kurangnya magnetosfer dan tipisnya atmosfer menjadi tantangan. Di permukaan planet ini tidak banyak terjadi perpindahan panas  penyekatan terhadap angin Surya terbilang rendah  sehingga dapat menyebabkan atmosfer Mars menjadi lebih tipis”Atmosfer Mars sangat tipis  hanya 1% yang merupakan atmosfer milik bumi  1 9% nitrogen  1 9% argon  sisanya adalah karbondioksida  dan sedikit jejak dari oksigen dan karbon monoksida. Penelitian di Mars mengungkapkan bahwa planet tersebut telah kehilangan atmosfernya  sebanyak 65% Argon yang pernah ada di atmosfernya telah hilang keluar angkasa. ""Kami telah menentukan bahwa sebagian besar gas yang pernah ada di atmosfer Mars telah hilang ke luar angkasa "" kata Bruce Jakosky  peneliti utama Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN)  Universitas Colorado di Boulder.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeInfografis ini menunjukkan bagaimana Mars kehilangan argon dan gas lainnya seiring waktu akibat 'sputtering’. Kredit: NASATantangan besar lainnya bagi misi untuk menjadikan Mars sebagai “Bumi kedua” adalah kondisi alam  Mars adalah gurun dingin  dengan struktur tanah yang keras dan berkerak. Mars terkenal dengan badai debu yang hebat  yang terkadang menimbulkan cukup banyak debu hingga dapat dilihat oleh teleskop dari bumi. Berdasarkan perkataan Michael Smith  seorang ilmuwan planet di Pusat Penerbangan Luar Angkasa Goddard NASA di Greenbelt  Maryland: “Setiap tahun ada beberapa badai debu yang cukup besar yang muncul di Mars dan menutupi area seukuran benua dan berlangsung selama berminggu-minggu ""Jika badainya bisa berlangsung selama berminggu-minggu  maka akan sangat sulit bagi manusia untuk membangun koloni di sana  tidak mungkin bagi manusia untuk dapat beraktivitas di tengah badai debu. Planet Mars juga hampir mati secara geologis; aktivitas vulkanik telah sepenuhnya berakhir  menyebabkan terhentinya pendaur ulangan bahan kimia dan mineral antara permukaan dengan bagian dalam planet.Jika sebuah koloni dibentuk  maka perlu usaha berkesinambungan dan berbiaya besar untuk memeliharanya  termasuk misi penyelamatan. Lebih jauh lagi  isolasi jangka panjang bagi penduduk Mars mungkin memakan korban. pada 2013 proyek Mars One mengumumkan ingin merekrut empat orang untuk dikirim dalam misi kolonisasi Mars  Chris Chamber  seorang profesor ilmu saraf kognitif di Universitas Cardiff  memperingatkan tentang risiko psikologis yang akan dihadapi oleh penduduk di Mars jika seandainya proses kolonisasi berjalan dan dalam skala yang besar.Penelitian pada tahun 2017  mengungkapkan bahwa permukaan Mars mungkin lebih berbahaya bagi mikroorganisme dari pada yang diduga.Dikutip dari Scientific Report  astronom Jennifer Wadsworth dan Charles S. Cockell  telah menemukan perklorat  sebuah zat yang membuat bakteri tidak dapat bertahan hidup  zat ini ditemukan melimpah di permukaan Mars.Namun  meskipun berbagai tantangan dihadapi  para peneliti tetap berupaya untuk membangun koloni di Mars. Berdasarkan pernyataan NASA: “Bahkan meskipun Mars tidak memiliki kehidupan masa lalu atau masa kini  bagaimanapun juga  masih banyak hal menarik di cakrawala. Kita sendiri mungkin menjadi “kehidupan di Mars  jika manusia memilih pergi kesana suatu hari nanti”Dalam upaya menyiapkan proses tersebut  NASA dan beberapa lembaga yang terlibat  menggelontorkan bermiliar-miliar dolar AS  untuk mengembangkan teknologi-teknologi terbaru yang nantinya berguna bagi misi kolonisasi di Mars  dimulai dengan pengembangan terhadap baju Astronot yang dapat melindungi mereka dari debu partikel yang merusak  hingga pengembangan fisi nuklir demi energi berkelanjutan di Mars.Melalui misi perseverance  pada tahun 2021 robot penjelajah milik NASA mendarat di Mars  sambil membawa empat sampel bahan pakaian antariksa  dan para ilmuwan melakukan penilaian bagaimana keempat pakaian tersebut dapat bertahan setelah empat tahun di planet Mars. Apa yang dipelajari badan antariksa tentang kinerja material dari keempat sampel pakaian tersebut  di Mars akan menjadi dasar perancangan pakaian antariksa masa depan bagi para astronot di Planet Merah.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA:” Sampel tersebut  masing-masing berukuran tiga perempat inci persegi (20 milimeter persegi)  merupakan bagian dari target kalibrasi yang digunakan untuk menguji pengaturan SHERLOC (Pemindaian Lingkungan Layak Huni dengan Raman & Luminescence untuk Bahan Organik dan Bahan Kimia)  instrumen di ujung lengan Perseverance.”Sampel-sampel tersebut meliputi sepotong pelindung helm polikarbonat; Vectran  bahan tahan potong yang digunakan untuk telapak tangan sarung tangan astronot; dua jenis Teflon  yang memiliki sifat anti-lengket anti-debu; dan bahan pakaian antariksa yang umum digunakan bernama Ortho-Fabric. Kain terakhir ini memiliki beberapa lapisan  termasuk Nomex  bahan tahan api yang ditemukan pada pakaian pemadam kebakaran; Gore-Tex  yang kedap air namun tetap bernapas; dan Kevlar  bahan kuat yang digunakan dalam rompi antipeluru yang membuat pakaian antariksa lebih tahan sobekPress enter or click to view image in full sizeGrafik ini menunjukkan ilustrasi prototipe pakaian antariksa (kiri)  beserta sampel pakaian yang dibawa oleh wahana penjelajah Perseverance milik NASA.

""Kami sedang mempersiapkan manusia untuk akhirnya pergi dan menjelajahi Mars.”Seolah selangkah lagi menuju terwujudnya peradaban di Mars  NASA berhasil membuat sebuah teknologi Produksi oksigen lokal (MOXIE)  yang bisa memproduksi oksigen dari atmosfer kaya akan karbondioksida di planet Mars.MOXIE sebuah benda kotak kecil yang dapat melakukan pekerjaan pohon untuk memproduksi oksigen. MOXIE bekerja dengan mengambil atmosfer Mars yang penuh dengan karbon dioksida melalui filter HEPA penangkap debu  kemudian mengompres atmosfer melalui pompa gulir  memanaskannya hingga 800°Celcius  dan mengirimkannya melalui rakitan elektrolisis oksida padat (SOXE)  tempat Karbon dioksida mengalir di atas katoda yang dikatalisis berbasis nikel dan terurai menjadi ion oksigen dan karbon monoksida. Elektrolit keramik zirkonia yang distabilkan scandia secara selektif melewatkan ion oksigen ke anoda  tempat ion-ion tersebut bergabung kembali menjadi oksigen diatomik  yang diukur jumlah dan kemurniannya sebelum dilepaskan ke atmosfer Mars. Buangan katoda adalah campuran karbon dioksida   karbon monoksida  dan gas atmosfer inert  terutama argon dan nitrogen.Press enter or click to view image in full sizeMOXIE dengan penutup depan dilepas  memperlihatkan kompresor dan rakitan SOXE.

Kredit: Science AdvanceMOXIE menjadi temuan yang menjanjikan bagi para ilmuwan  dalam rencananya  MOXIE harus dikirim terlebih dahulu ke Mars sebelum misi Manusia.""Ini adalah demonstrasi pertama yang benar-benar menggunakan sumber daya di permukaan benda planet lain  dan mengubahnya secara kimiawi menjadi sesuatu yang akan berguna untuk misi manusia "" kata wakil penyelidik utama MOXIE Jeffrey Hoffman  seorang profesor praktik di Departemen MIT bidang Aeronautika dan Astronautika.Teknologi Laser  kecepatan komunikasi dari Mars ke Bumi.Teknologi radio yang digunakan saat ini membutuhkan waktu yang sangat lama untuk mengirim peta Mars ke Bumi  setidaknya membutuhkan waktu selama sembilan tahun  tetapi dengan teknologi laser yang baru dikembangkan oleh NASA  alih-alih sembilan tahun  waktu tersebut bisa dipersingkat menjadi 9 Minggu saja. Misi manusia ke Mars lebih baik menggunakan teknologi Laser untuk tetap terhubung dengan Bumi. Teknologi Laser ini  bisa mengirimkan sejumlah besar Informasi dan data secara real-time termasuk gambar dan video.Dari Situs resmi NASA: “NASA membuktikan komunikasi laser mungkin dengan demonstrasi dari Bulan pada tahun 2013. Demo berikutnya dari badan tersebut akan bekerja melalui berbagai skenario operasional  menyempurnakan sistem penunjuk  dan mengatasi tantangan teknologi dari orbit Bumi rendah – hal-hal seperti awan dan gangguan komunikasi lainnya. NASA sedang membangun sistem kecil untuk menguji penerbangan luar angkasa manusia  termasuk di Stasiun Luar Angkasa Internasional dan misi Artemis berawak pertama. Muatan komunikasi laser lainnya akan menjelajah ke luar angkasa untuk membantu menginformasikan apa yang diperlukan untuk menggunakan teknologi yang sama jutaan dan jutaan mil jauhnya dari Bumi”Berbeda dengan Bumi  Mars tidak memiliki sumber daya yang melimpah  sehingga dibutuhkan teknologi yang bisa memasok listrik ke Mars tanpa batas.Badai debu di Mars dapat mengurangi jumlah cahaya matahari yang masuk  selain itu  partikel-partikel debu di Mars sangat kecil dan bersifat elektrostatik.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA  “Debu merupakan masalah yang sangat besar bagi panel surya. Bahkan pusaran debu berukuran hanya beberapa kaki—yang jauh lebih kecil daripada badai debu biasa—dapat membawa debu yang cukup banyak untuk menutupi peralatan dan mengurangi jumlah sinar matahari yang mengenai panel. Berkurangnya sinar matahari berarti berkurangnya energi yang dihasilkan”Ini berarti bahwa panel Surya sangat rentan terhadap ancaman debu  sehingga sangat tidak cocok jika digunakan di Mars  untuk mengatasi tantangan ini  NASA mengembangkan teknologi fisi nuklir demi pasokan listrik yang aman dan berkelanjutan di Mars.Dikutip dari situs resmi NASA  “NASA telah menguji teknologi fisi nuklir Bumi dan menunjukkan bahwa teknologi ini aman  efisien  dan cukup berlimpah untuk memungkinkan misi permukaan jangka panjang. NASA berencana untuk mendemonstrasikan dan menggunakan sistem tenaga fisi di Bulan terlebih dahulu  kemudian di Mars.”Press enter or click to view image in full sizeIlustrasi konsep sistem tenaga fisi nuklir di Mars.

Dengan melihat progres penelitian yang dilakukan manusia  membuat kita optimis akan adanya tempat tinggal baru  di planet baru. Di Masa depan  populasi manusia di bumi tidak akan terhitung jumlahnya  di umur bumi yang sudah semakin tua  merupakan alasan tepat bagi manusia untuk mencari potensi planet lain sebagai tempat tinggal baru.Sumber:Artikel:45 years ago: Viking 1 Touches Down on Mars (john Uri  2021) https://www-nasa-gov.translate.goog/history/45-years-ago-viking-1-touches-down-on-mars/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=id&_x_tr_hl=id&_x_tr_pto=sge#:~:text=Pada%20musim%20panas%201976%2C%20sepasang yang%20mendarat%20di%20planet%20lain.NASA Research Suggests Mars Once Had More Water Than Earth’s Arctic Ocean (NASA  2015) https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-research-suggests-mars-once-had-more-water-than-earths-arctic-ocean/Adakah Kehidupan di Planet Mars?

But human thinking doesn’t always move like that. We loop. We pause. We zoom in and out. We shift tone depending on mood  energy  or cognitive load.Despite advances in human-AI collaboration  current systems still prioritize task efficiency over cognitive resonance – neglecting how humans actually navigate complex thought (Amershi et al.  2019; Shneiderman  2020).This reflection stems from lived experimentation – not academic research  but hands-on orchestration of AI threads across real-world creative  strategic  and emotional work.Beyond Input-Output: Orchestration as Interaction DesignWhen I started working with multiple AI threads – one for structure  one for tone  one for insight – something changed. Instead of trying to “get better prompts ” I began conducting the system like a layered conversation.That shift led me to develop:Flow Anchors™ – simple prompts like “Pause for synthesis” or “Switch rhythm” to regulate attention and momentum (see also Zimmerman  2002).Meaning Modulation™ – adjusting the tone  style  or depth of AI responses based on my emotional or cognitive bandwidth (see Picard  1997; Tkalčič & Chen  2015).These aren’t productivity hacks. They’re scaffolds for metacognition and emotional self-regulation – still mostly missing from AI design.What’s Missing in Current Research and DesignWhile agentic AI  adaptive learning systems  and AI tutors are rapidly evolving  there’s still limited focus on:Emotionally responsive UX in AI workflowsTools that support cognitive rhythm and reflectionMetacognitive scaffolding in everyday AI interaction (Winne & Hadwin  1998; Sengers et al.  2005)In educational and design contexts  we’re still building AI to inform – not to resonate.A Personal Framework: The Valley of CollaborationOver time  I started visualizing the process as a terrain – what I now call the Valley of Collaboration. In this model  AI agents play different cognitive roles. The human moves between them – not linearly  but rhythmically. Not just as “user ” but as navigator.This valley isn’t a product. It’s a way to think about thinking – and design for it.Closing ThoughtThis isn’t a research paper. It’s a field note. But it points to something worth exploring:What would AI look like if it helped us think in rhythm with ourselves?Not just smarter – but softer. Not just fast – but aware.Let’s build tools that adapt as we do.Methodology & ContextThis article presents a reflective synthesis grounded in practitioner-based inquiry rather than empirical experimentation. The concepts discussed – such as Flow Anchors™  Meaning Modulation™  and the Valley of Collaboration – emerged through sustained interaction with AI systems (primarily large language models) in the context of creative ideation  strategy development  and learning design.Over the course of several months  I engaged in structured multi-threaded dialogues with AI agents  each assigned a distinct cognitive role (e.g.  strategist  editor  emotional mirror). These sessions were iteratively documented  clustered  and synthesized using digital scaffolding tools such as Notion. Recurring patterns in emotional rhythm  cognitive pacing  and task navigation informed the conceptual models presented here.This work draws from a multidisciplinary foundation – including cognitive science  affective computing  metacognitive theory  and reflective UX design – to explore how AI systems might support more emotionally attuned and cognitively adaptive human workflows.Although exploratory and situated in practice  the intention is to contribute to an ongoing conversation within human-computer interaction (HCI)  educational technology  and AI-assisted cognition. This article should be read as an applied perspective that bridges lived experience with theoretical insight – intended to invite further dialogue and refinement across disciplines.✍️ About the AuthorSára Olsen works across psychology  language  and creative systems design.

The brutal reality is that lens purchases gone wrong hurt because good glass costs so much and directly determines whether you can accept paying jobs.     1. Paying for f/1.2 You Do Not Use The lens sits in the display case like jewelry  that 85mm f/1.2 gleaming under the shop lights. The sales pitch writes itself: ultimate bokeh  extraordinary low-light performance  the pinnacle of optical engineering. You imagine portraits with backgrounds that melt into impressionist paintings  available light wedding ceremonies captured without flash  street photography in near darkness. At $3 000  it costs more than many camera bodies  but surely this represents an investment in artistic excellence. Six months later  you pull up your Lightroom catalog and filter by that lens. The metadata tells an embarrassing story. Of 2 000 images shot with your prized f/1.2  exactly twelve were captured wide open. The vast majority cluster around f/2.8 to f/4. Those dreamy portraits you imagined? You shot them at f/2 because your clients kept complaining that only one eye was in focus at f/1.2. Those dark wedding ceremonies? You used f/1.8 with higher ISO because you needed more depth of field to capture both people in couples shots. The $3 000 lens delivered $1 200 lens performance because that's all you actually used. The mathematics of ultra-fast apertures reveal uncomfortable truths. Moving from f/2 to f/1.4 gains you a stop of light. In practical terms  that's the difference between ISO 3200 and ISO 1600  a distinction that's close to invisible in final output from a modern camera and processing software. But the price difference between the standard 85mm f/1.8 and the 85mm f/1.4 of f/1.2 is often about $1 000.  The depth of field at f/1.2 creates more problems than it solves for working photographers. On a full frame camera at 85mm  focusing on a subject's near eye at 8 feet gives you roughly 2 inches of depth at f/1.2. The far eye goes soft. The nose blurs. Any movement forward or backward throws the shot completely out of focus. Your keeper rate plummets while your stress levels soar. Meanwhile  at f/2  you get about 4 inches of depth  enough to keep a face sharp while still achieving beautiful background separation. Professional portrait photographers discovered this decades ago  which is why so many work at f/2.8 to f/4 despite owning faster glass. Consider the physical penalties of ultra-fast glass. The Canon RF 50mm f/1.2L weighs 950 grams. The RF 50mm f/1.8 STM weighs 160 grams. You're carrying six times the weight for that extra stop. The f/1.2 version also requires 77mm filters at premium prices  while the f/1.8 uses affordable 43mm filters. Pack three f/1.2 primes for a wedding  and you've added 6 pounds to your bag before considering cameras or other gear. Autofocus precision becomes critical and problematic with ultra-fast apertures. The margin for error at f/1.2 is so thin that minor issues ruin shots. The slightest front or back focus (if you're using a DSLR) that goes unnoticed at f/2.8 becomes catastrophic at f/1.2 (ask me about my adventures with that).    Video work exposes another f/1.2 liability that photographers rarely consider until too late. That gorgeous shallow depth of field becomes a nightmare when subjects move even slightly. Professional videographers rarely shoot wider than f/2.8 for interviews because maintaining focus at f/1.2 while someone gestures naturally is nearly impossible. You'll need variable ND filters to control exposure in daylight  adding $200 to $400 per lens. The focus breathing on many f/1.2 lenses makes focusing jarring. Suddenly that ""cinema-quality"" lens requires so many workarounds that a modest f/1.8 or f/2 alternative would produce better results. The optical compromises at maximum aperture further diminish the value proposition. Even premium lenses often show noticeable vignetting  reduced contrast  and corner softness when shot wide open. You're paying premium prices for performance that the lens can't fully deliver. Most f/1.2 or f/1.4 lenses reach peak sharpness around f/2.8 to f/4  exactly where you'd get similar results from an f/1.8 lens costing half as much. Rent that dream f/1.2 lens for a typical job. Shoot your normal subjects in your usual conditions. Then examine the files critically. Can you consistently nail focus at f/1.2? Do clients notice or care about the difference between f/1.2 and f/1.8 backgrounds? Does the extra weight slow you down or cause fatigue? Most importantly  review your current work and count how many images would have genuinely benefited from f/1.2 versus f/1.8. If it's less than 20%  you're shopping for specifications  not solutions. 2. Skipping Weather-Sealing The rain starts during the ceremony. Not a downpour  just steady drops that send guests scrambling for cover. You're the wedding photographer  so you keep shooting  confident in your skills and determination. Twenty minutes later  your $2 000 lens stops focusing. The autofocus motor whirs but won't lock. By reception time  condensation fogs the rear element. Monday morning  the repair estimate arrives: $800 and three weeks without your primary portrait lens.  Weather-sealing sounds like insurance you'll never need until the moment you desperately need it. Photographers consistently underestimate their exposure to moisture  dust  and environmental hazards. It's not just rain you're fighting. Beach sand infiltrates focus rings within minutes. Concert fog machines coat front elements with glycol residue. Kitchen steam from food photography condenses inside lens barrels. Sweat from your hands corrodes lens contacts during summer weddings. Your own breath fogs unprotected glass when shooting winter sports. Dust infiltration creates insidious problems that accumulate over time. Without sealing  zoom lenses can act like bellows  sucking particles into the barrel with every focal length change. Initially  you might notice a few specks that don't affect image quality. After a year of regular use  especially in dusty environments  the internal elements develop a haze that reduces contrast and causes flare. This is a particular issue with push-pull zoom lenses.   Salt air devastates unsealed lenses faster than photographers realize. One beach portrait session can start corrosion that spreads for months. The metal components in aperture mechanisms oxidize. Electronic contacts develop resistance that causes communication errors. Zoom rings become gritty and resistant. A good lens includes fluorine coating on the front element specifically to repel salt spray  while budget telephoto lenses lacking this protection require constant cleaning that eventually scratches the coating. Professional use amplifies the importance of weather-sealing exponentially. A hobbyist can choose when to shoot. Professionals shoot when clients pay them  regardless of conditions. That proposal on the rain-soaked beach happens whether your gear is ready or not. The outdoor corporate event proceeds through morning mist. The music festival continues through dust storms. Sports rarely stop for weather. With sealed lenses  you keep working. Without sealing  you're either risking equipment damage or losing income. Internal focusing and zoom designs provide benefits beyond moisture protection. Lenses that extend during zooming or focusing constantly exchange air with the environment  pulling in whatever's floating around. An internal design also improves balance on gimbals and reduces the likelihood of impact damage from the extending barrel hitting objects. The resale value difference between sealed and unsealed lenses grows over time. A three-year-old weather-sealed lens that's been properly maintained looks and functions like new. An unsealed lens used in the same conditions shows its age through accumulated internal dust  worn coatings  and potentially degraded mechanics.    3. Underestimating Weight and Balance The lens arrives in its impressive box  a monument to optical excellence. On paper  the specifications dazzle: incredible sharpness  creamy bokeh  professional build quality. You mount it on your camera for the first test shoot. Within fifteen minutes  your wrist aches. After an hour  sharp pain shoots up your forearm. By the end of a full portrait session  you can barely hold the camera steady. The lens weighs several pounds  nearly twice what your camera body weighs  creating a front-heavy combination that transforms photography from joy to endurance test. Balance matters more than absolute weight  a principle photographers learn through painful experience. A 1 000-gram lens with proper weight distribution feels lighter than a 700-gram lens that puts all its mass at the front element. That leverage principle means every gram past your grip point counts double or triple in fatigue terms. The cumulative effect of poor balance appears gradually but inevitably. Your minimum handholdable shutter speed increases because micro-tremors from muscle fatigue create camera shake. What you could shoot at 1/125 second in the morning requires 1/250 second by afternoon. Your composition suffers because you're rushing to relieve strain rather than waiting for perfect moments. You start avoiding certain angles because holding the camera overhead or at arm's length becomes painful. The technical quality of your work declines not because of skill but because of physical limitation. Working photographers discover that theoretical optical superiority means nothing if the lens stays home. That Sigma 105mm f/1.4 Art might produce marginally better bokeh than the 85mm f/1.8  but if you're leaving it behind because of weight  you're getting zero bokeh instead of slightly less perfect bokeh. The Canon RF 85mm f/2 Macro IS STM weighs 500 grams and balances perfectly on any RF body. It might not win lens charts competitions  but it wins the only competition that matters: actually being used to create images. Event photography crystallizes the weight penalty sharply. A wedding photographer typically shoots for eight to twelve hours  raises the camera hundreds of times  walks several miles  crouches  climbs  stretches. Every extra gram compounds across thousands of movements. Two photographers with identical skills but different lens choices will produce different results by hour ten.  Tripod and gimbal work reveals another weight consideration photographers overlook. Heavy lenses require heavier support systems. That lightweight travel tripod rated for 3 kilograms might technically support your 2-kilogram lens and camera combination  but it won't always dampen vibrations effectively. You need a tripod rated for double your actual load for stability  meaning heavier legs  bigger heads  and more weight to carry. The landscape photographer choosing the lighter option can hike farther  stay out longer  and access locations the heavier lens would make impossible. Video work amplifies balance problems exponentially. Handheld video with a front-heavy lens produces unwatchable footage as micro-tremors translate into jittery motion. Gimbal motors strain against unbalanced loads  burning through batteries and potentially burning out motors.  The grip enhancement trap catches photographers who try to solve balance problems with accessories. Adding a battery grip seems logical for improving balance with heavy lenses. But now you're carrying extra battery weight all day even when using light lenses. You've solved one problem by creating another  adding systemic weight instead of addressing the real issue: lens selection. 4. Buying Specialty Primes Before Workhorse Glass The vintage lens groups online seduce you with their rendering character. Your cart fills with fascinating specialty glass that will define your unique style. Meanwhile  you don't own a single zoom lens or conventional prime that covers standard focal lengths reliably. Three months later  reality delivers its verdict. A client needs corporate headshots with consistent sharpness  not artistic blur. A wedding couple wants group photos of thirty people  not shallow depth of field experiments. An event requires coverage from 24mm to 200mm  not the three artistic primes you bought. You've spent $3 000 on glass you can't use professionally and now need another $5 000 for lenses that actually generate income. The portfolio deception drives many poor purchase decisions. Photographers see striking images created with unusual lenses and assume they need similar tools. That infrared photograph captured with a converted sensor and special filters looks otherworldly. The tilt-shift architectural image corrects perspective beautifully. The macro photograph reveals details invisible to naked eyes. But examine most working photographers' metadata and you'll find 80% of professional images come from boring  practical focal lengths: 24-70mm and 70-200mm zooms or 35mm  50mm  and 85mm primes. The spectacular portfolio pieces grab attention  but the workhorse lenses pay bills. Building backwards from specialty to general creates coverage gaps that embarrass professionals. You can't shoot group photos with your 135mm f/1.8 portrait lens unless you have a football field of space. The manual focus 40mm f/1.2 that renders beautifully can't track moving subjects at weddings. Each specialty lens excels at one thing while failing at ten others. Professional work demands versatility first  specialization second. The rental market reveals what photographers actually need versus what they want. Check any rental house's most popular lenses and you'll see those aforementioned boring lenses. These aren't exciting. They don't create unique looks. But they're rented constantly because they solve real problems. The exotic lenses sit on shelves except for specific projects where their unique capabilities justify the rental fee. This pattern should inform purchase priorities  but photographers consistently ignore it. The learning curve for specialty lenses compounds the problem. Mastering a tilt-shift lens requires understanding Scheimpflug principle  practicing movements  and developing new composition instincts. Achieving consistent results with ultra-fast manual focus lenses demands different shooting techniques. Macro photography needs specialized lighting and stabilization approaches. While you're learning these specialized skills  you're not improving with the standard lenses that most clients actually need. You become an amateur in multiple specialties instead of a professional in core competencies. 5. Forgetting Focus Breathing for Video The interview setup looks professional. Your subject sits perfectly lit  everything dialed in for a cinematic look. You start with a wide shot for context  then slowly rack focus to the subject's face for emotional impact. On the monitor  something horrifying happens. As focus shifts  the frame noticeably zooms  making it appear like you're simultaneously focusing and zooming. The subject's head grows larger  the background shifts  and the entire shot screams ""amateur production"" despite your expensive lens. Focus breathing  the change in focal length as focus distance changes  affects most photography lenses to varying degrees. Manufacturers optimize still lenses for maximum sharpness and bokeh quality  often accepting breathing as a compromise. For photography  this rarely matters. For video  it's catastrophic. Every focus pull becomes a distraction that breaks viewer immersion. The problem multiplies with modern autofocus systems that constantly hunt for precision. Your camera's face detection makes micro-adjustments continuously  causing the frame to pulse subtly as breathing translates these focus movements into magnification changes. What looks like nervous camera work is actually your lens breathing with every AF adjustment.  Cinema lenses exist specifically to eliminate these problems  but their prices shock photographers. The difference? Perfect breathing control  standard gear positions  consistent size across focal lengths  and apertures marked in T-stops for accurate exposure. For photographers shooting occasional video  cinema lenses are overkill. But understanding why they cost more helps evaluate whether breathing matters for your work. Electronic breathing compensation offers a partial solution with significant limitations. Sony's breathing compensation in cameras like the a7 IV crops the image to maintain consistent framing during focus changes. This works but costs resolution and field of view. You're essentially shooting with a longer focal length and lower resolution than expected. The compensation also only works with specific Sony lenses  leaving third-party options without correction. Similar compromises happen with other systems. Professional videographers develop workarounds that photographers should understand. They pull focus more slowly to make breathing less noticeable. They compose with extra room to allow cropping in post. They choose interview positions where breathing won't intersect with important background elements. Some use zoom lenses instead of primes  counterintuitively  because many modern zooms breathe less than primes. Or  they use cinema lenses.  The Strategic Lens Purchase Smart lens purchasing starts with brutal honesty about actual needs versus gear acquisition syndrome. That dream lens collection on your wishlist might impress forums but won't improve your photography if it doesn't match your shooting reality. Professional photographers often succeed with surprisingly modest lens selections. They choose reliability over perfection  versatility over specialization  and proven performance over cutting-edge technology. The 24-70mm f/2.8 might not excite you  but it stays mounted on more professional cameras than any exotic prime because it solves real problems reliably. Understanding this principle before purchasing saves thousands of dollars and years of frustration. Your next lens purchase should fill a genuine gap in capability  not a perceived gap in quality. If clients are happy with your current images  that f/1.2 upgrade won't generate more bookings. If you're consistently renting the same focal length  that's your next purchase. If weather cancellations cost you money  prioritize sealed lenses. Build your lens collection like a business tool inventory  not an art collection. The lens that makes you money is always better than the lens that makes you excited.

More info.            Samsung is now selling both the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Flip 5 as Certified Re-Newed  allowing buyers to get in the foldable action without having to spend new-phone prices to do so. Outfitted with genuine Samsung parts  the phones receive new batteries and a one-year warranty  meaning you can enjoy the confidence of like-new flagship performance for a heckuva lot less paper. For example  the Galaxy Z Fold 5 starts at just $1 169 for the 256GB model  while the Z Flip 5 starts at only $649.      For those with a trade-in device  Samsung will still take that. Surprisingly  buyers can save up to $866 off the price of a Z Fold 5 when trading in select phones. That brings your total down to $303 for the Z Fold 5. That seems fine  but you have to have a very nice to trade in. We like the Re-Newed program. There is no reason that older phones can’t find new homes and be used for a long time. It warms out hearts.

Quisque arcu lorem  ultricies quis pellentesque nec  ullamcorper eu odio.      Bitcoin surged to a fresh all-time high of $124 500 just hours ago  but the celebration was short-lived as the price quickly retraced to the $121 500 level. The sudden pullback has split market opinion: some analysts interpret the drop as a sign of waning momentum  while others see it as a healthy pause before another breakout attempt.  Related Reading               Ethereum 30-Day Netflow Average Deepens Negative: Buyers Dominate Market      1 day ago          Adding to the intrigue  key data from CryptoQuant reveals that BTC volatility — measured by the 30-day Price High & Low metric — has compressed to its lowest point in two years. This metric tracks the range between Bitcoin’s rolling 30-day high and low  and its current tight squeeze suggests a rare balance between supply and demand. Liquidity has been clustering above local highs near $120K and below recent lows around $113K  creating a coiled-spring effect in the price structure. Historically  such volatility compression phases often precede significant range expansions. The question now is whether Bitcoin will break upward  continuing its long-term bull trend  or slip into a deeper correction if selling pressure gains traction. With the market sitting near record highs and volatility at multi-year lows  traders are bracing for what could be the next decisive move in Bitcoin’s 2025 rally.                  Bitcoin Volatility Compression Signals Imminent Move According to top analyst Axel Adler  Bitcoin’s 30-day Price High & Low metric is showing one of its tightest readings in years. The range between BTC’s rolling 30-day high and low has narrowed significantly  while the bands themselves — representing the rolling maximum and minimum prices — have compressed tightly around the current price. This pattern is a textbook sign of volatility contraction. Bitcoin 30-day Price High and Low All Time | Source: Axel Adler Adler explains that such compression typically reflects a balance between supply and demand and a period of low realized volatility. In this phase  liquidity tends to concentrate just above local highs  currently around $120 000  and just below local lows  near $113 000. This creates a situation where price movement is contained within a narrow band  with traders positioning themselves on both sides in anticipation of the next breakout. The coming days will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s short-term structure. If BTC can break above the $120K–$124K zone  it could trigger another leg higher in its uptrend. However  a breakdown below $113K would increase the risk of a deeper correction  potentially shifting market sentiment.

The move comes just a day after BTC briefly broke above the key $123 217 resistance level  approaching the $124 000 psychological barrier before pulling back. This zone remains the most significant obstacle for bulls  as it has capped upward moves multiple times. BTC testing liquidity below ATH | Source: BTCUSDT chart on TradingView Price action shows BTC maintaining a bullish structure above its major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($116 948)  100 SMA ($117 653)  and 200 SMA ($112 495). This alignment signals continued strength in the medium term  with the 50 SMA acting as immediate dynamic support.

A decisive breakout and sustained close above $124K would likely trigger momentum buying and open the door to new all-time highs. Conversely  a failure to reclaim $123K could lead to renewed selling pressure  with initial support at $120K and deeper support near the $117K–$118K range.

Quisque arcu lorem  ultricies quis pellentesque nec  ullamcorper eu odio.      Bitcoin surged to a fresh all-time high of $124 500 just hours ago  but the celebration was short-lived as the price quickly retraced to the $121 500 level. The sudden pullback has split market opinion: some analysts interpret the drop as a sign of waning momentum  while others see it as a healthy pause before another breakout attempt.  Related Reading               Ethereum 30-Day Netflow Average Deepens Negative: Buyers Dominate Market      1 day ago          Adding to the intrigue  key data from CryptoQuant reveals that BTC volatility — measured by the 30-day Price High & Low metric — has compressed to its lowest point in two years. This metric tracks the range between Bitcoin’s rolling 30-day high and low  and its current tight squeeze suggests a rare balance between supply and demand. Liquidity has been clustering above local highs near $120K and below recent lows around $113K  creating a coiled-spring effect in the price structure. Historically  such volatility compression phases often precede significant range expansions. The question now is whether Bitcoin will break upward  continuing its long-term bull trend  or slip into a deeper correction if selling pressure gains traction. With the market sitting near record highs and volatility at multi-year lows  traders are bracing for what could be the next decisive move in Bitcoin’s 2025 rally.                  Bitcoin Volatility Compression Signals Imminent Move According to top analyst Axel Adler  Bitcoin’s 30-day Price High & Low metric is showing one of its tightest readings in years. The range between BTC’s rolling 30-day high and low has narrowed significantly  while the bands themselves — representing the rolling maximum and minimum prices — have compressed tightly around the current price. This pattern is a textbook sign of volatility contraction. Bitcoin 30-day Price High and Low All Time | Source: Axel Adler Adler explains that such compression typically reflects a balance between supply and demand and a period of low realized volatility. In this phase  liquidity tends to concentrate just above local highs  currently around $120 000  and just below local lows  near $113 000. This creates a situation where price movement is contained within a narrow band  with traders positioning themselves on both sides in anticipation of the next breakout. The coming days will be critical in determining Bitcoin’s short-term structure. If BTC can break above the $120K–$124K zone  it could trigger another leg higher in its uptrend. However  a breakdown below $113K would increase the risk of a deeper correction  potentially shifting market sentiment.

The move comes just a day after BTC briefly broke above the key $123 217 resistance level  approaching the $124 000 psychological barrier before pulling back. This zone remains the most significant obstacle for bulls  as it has capped upward moves multiple times. BTC testing liquidity below ATH | Source: BTCUSDT chart on TradingView Price action shows BTC maintaining a bullish structure above its major moving averages — the 50 SMA ($116 948)  100 SMA ($117 653)  and 200 SMA ($112 495). This alignment signals continued strength in the medium term  with the 50 SMA acting as immediate dynamic support.

A decisive breakout and sustained close above $124K would likely trigger momentum buying and open the door to new all-time highs. Conversely  a failure to reclaim $123K could lead to renewed selling pressure  with initial support at $120K and deeper support near the $117K–$118K range.

Passport Tokyo: The Walkabout Mini Golf Path Crosses Capybara & Neko Atsume KittiesRelax with capybara or putt with Neko Atsume cats in Passport Tokyo available now in Walkabout Mini Golf.    Passport Tokyo: Walkabout Mini Golf Path Crosses Capybaras & Neko Atsume Kitties                                                                  Skip to content     Search            Sign In Support Us         Reviews   Best of VR   Podcast   Showcase                 VR Gaming  Passport Tokyo: Walkabout Mini Golf Path Crosses Capybaras & Neko Atsume Kitties       &  Ian Hamilton       Today      Share to Reddit      Share to Facebook      Share to WhatsApp                  The design team behind Walkabout Mini Golf occasionally leaves their homes to gather for a retreat in the physical world.Funded by sales of the VR game and its add-on destinations  like the newly released Tokyo  Walkabout's originator Lucas Martell occasionally brings together Don Carson  Laura Krause  and Henning Koczy. These retreats are usually held somewhere beautiful  with dinners or hikes on the schedule. They also involve a grueling amount of time wearing Quest headsets in the gray mess of Gravity Sketch.That’s where they build new mini golf courses. Dropping hole markers one by one  from 1 to 18  they make a yellow line charting their plan for the Walkabout path. Passport Tokyo started in one of those retreats  before Krause joined Mighty Coconut last year  but its release today informally marks the beginning of her contributions to the team even as Walkabout's creators work on courses that won’t open in VR until 2027. Bottom line? If you visit a capybara in Passport Tokyo  you have Krause to thank.“When I started on the tea room and onsen  I felt like I had figured out the important bits but they were definitely missing something ” Krause wrote to UploadVR. “I remember I was cooking dinner after staring at hours of Tokyo research when it dawned on me... Capybaras! Not only are there animal cafes around Tokyo  but the zoo where capybaras bathe with yuzu fruit is just a short train ride from the city. They felt like the perfect fit to unify those two areas while making them much more playful and more Walkabout.”The Walkabout Mini Golf ProcessThe Walkabout design team slowly molds those graybox sketches into destinations with surprising attractions sprinkled throughout. They do it a bit like chefs in the kitchen  handing the courses to one another for a pass lasting days or weeks at a time. Sometimes it takes 18 months to fully bake and serve a Walkabout Mini Golf course.So that's how  amid the city streets and old town areas of Tokyo  visitors might find themselves suddenly transfixed by sights and sounds that surprise around every corner. That includes purring cats  bathing capybaras  the clinking of wind chimes  and an entryway with interactive fabric draped across the path.Emma Mercado is one of the 3D artists who define a lot of the decorations seen across Walkabout's courses. They call it “set dec ” and she pulls from a library of hundreds of objects or creates new ones to make scenes that tell mini-stories  helping create a lived-in feel across both the day and night modes of each course.Martell  Mercado  and Carson joined me in Passport Tokyo ahead of its launch to walk through their design process. Martell confirmed they've got at least one more Passport destination planned for the release calendar  and the next design retreat is coming up in a couple of months to sketch out the next set of ideas.In 2022  I toured Walkabout's 20 000 Leagues Under The Sea with the course marking the informal start of Carson's contributions. Carson joined just as the studio started revealing surprising partnerships for destinations  like Myst and Labyrinth. In 2025  the game's recent run of courses includes Viva Las Elvis  Crystal Lair and Raptor Cliff's marking an increase in colorful signage and surprising technical features injected into these environments.                       0:00                              /1:11   1×               With no outside investment propping up Mighty Coconut  Martell's work assembling this art team and building out a process with them remains a core focus of coverage at UploadVR. You can visit Walkabout from all major VR headsets and iOS as well.Tour through Passport Tokyo in the video above with Martell  Carson  and Mercado offering behind-the-scenes commentary detailing the Walkabout design process.

That is why I have set up a facility with DonorBox where you can contribute to the costs of the website and time invested in writing and research for the news articles. It's very similar to the way The Guardian and many smaller websites are now seeking to generate an income in the face of rising costs and declining advertising. Whether it's a one-off donation or a regular giver  every additional support goes a long way to covering the running costs of this website  and keeping you regularly topped up doses of Londony news and facts.

Aug 14th  2025 9:00am by    Margaret Dawson        Image from Bruce Rolff on Shutterstock.            Chronosphere sponsored this post.          It’s wild to think that just a decade ago  we were dipping our toes into containers and Kubernetes. Fast-forward to today  and cloud native architectures are the foundation for modern application development and infrastructure  now including AI workloads. While some organizations are still catching up  most enterprises have containerized 20 to 50% of their workloads. And of course  cloud-born companies are fully containerized from Day 1. The Realities of Hybrid Multicloud Complexity Containerized microservices bring agility  composability and scale. But they also introduce challenges. Public cloud costs can spiral. Infrastructure outages can affect business continuity. That’s why so many organizations are now embracing hybrid  multicloud architectures  distributing workloads across multiple public clouds while maintaining private cloud deployments on premises. In theory  this gives us the best of both worlds: flexibility  resilience and cost control. In practice  it adds layers of complexity. Now we need to update  secure and observe distributed systems that span cloud and on-premises systems that are used by both operators and developers. The dream was always a “single pane of glass” to manage it all. Instead  we got tool sprawl  disjointed data and higher operational overhead. Why Standardizing Key Layers Matters In conversations with organizations across the globe  I often find myself helping teams identify the layers in their architecture that are ripe for standardization. The goal? Improve security  reduce costs and simplify management without restricting developer freedom. The infrastructure should be an abstraction layer — available when  where and how developers need it. To get there  we need to make bold decisions about our architecture. That includes container orchestration  operating systems  automation and observability  among others. Because here’s the reality: We can’t deliver innovation at the pace the market demands while juggling dozens of OS versions or six different monitoring tools that don’t talk to each other. The Value of Standardization in Observability Let’s hone in on observability  because it’s arguably one of the most strategic of those layers  and yet  one that too often flies under the radar. In modern  cloud native environments  microservices generate an avalanche of telemetry data: logs  metrics  traces  events — you name it. And with workloads scattered across clouds and data centers  visibility becomes fragmented fast. That complexity has led to skyrocketing observability costs  not to mention longer mean time to resolution (MTTR). Ironically  the tools designed to help us move fast are now slowing us down. Modern observability solutions are built to natively support Kubernetes across hybrid and multicloud deployments. The right solution doesn’t just collect data — it correlates it  simplifies it and helps you take action (without blowing up your budget). 3 Ways Observability Unifies Hybrid Multicloud Workloads Let’s break this down into three practical benefits: 1. Unified Visibility Across All Environments The challenge In hybrid or multicloud deployments  containerized workloads can live just about anywhere — on premises  in AWS  Google Cloud Platform  Azure or all of the above. Traditional monitoring tools create siloed dashboards that slow down incident response and frustrate engineers. The fix Adopt a Software as a Service (SaaS) observability platform built for cloud native environments. It should provide correlated  unified visibility across all telemetry types — logs  metrics  traces — regardless of where the data is generated. A true unified view means engineers and operators can detect and resolve issues faster. That single pane of glass? It’s not a fantasy — it’s finally achievable. 2. Focus on the Most Useful Data The challenge With so much telemetry data  it’s hard to know what matters. Teams often store everything “just in case ” driving up storage costs and adding noise that slows down remediation. The fix A smart observability platform identifies high-utility data automatically — what’s queried  visualized  tagged or correlated. That means teams can retain only what they need  when they need it. Less clutter  better context and significantly lower costs. In some cases  we’ve seen organizations reduce telemetry volume (and cost) by up to 84% while improving MTTR by over 50%. 3. Leveraging a Telemetry Pipeline The challenge Telemetry data is growing fast. Logs alone are up 250% in many organizations. Teams need a way to collect  process and route this data efficiently across diverse environments. The fix A telemetry pipeline centralizes data ingestion  processing and routing into a single interface. The ideal solution supports virtual machine (VM)- and container-based systems across on-premises and public cloud deployments. This gives teams full control over their observability data  while simplifying operations and reducing overhead. Final Thoughts Observability is no longer just a “nice to have” across the hybrid cloud. It’s foundational for modern enterprises navigating the realities of hybrid and multicloud infrastructure. Standardizing your observability stack is one of the smartest moves you can make to:  Accelerate innovation by unblocking developers. Increase uptime and improve user experience. Cut costs without sacrificing visibility. Simplify operations across fragmented environments.  If you’re scaling hybrid multicloud and want to stay ahead  it’s time to treat observability like a first-class architectural layer.

The vote  which took place at the firm’s extraordinary general meeting (EGM)  resulted in 67% of shareholders voting in favour of the proposed transaction. Rupert Dorey  Chairman of the Board of Third Point Investors Limited said: “Following extensive consultation with our shareholders  the Board is delighted that a significant majority agree that the combination with Malibu represents a unique opportunity to bring a high-quality reinsurance platform to the London market that has the potential to deliver superior value for investors. Throughout this process the Board has been fully cognisant of its duty to the Company and its shareholders as a whole. “This required an innovative solution that broke from the status quo  had the opportunity to deliver superior value for all shareholders  and that could succeed in winning the support of investors given the conflicting points of view. The Board is confident it has found that balance through a thorough  transparent and independent process  and on behalf of shareholders is genuinely excited by the potential within Malibu. We now look forward to completing the Acquisition and are firmly focused on scaling the platform for success over the coming period.” Back in July  TPIL announced an improved Redemption Offer for shareholders who wanted to exit their investment. The deal is structured as an all-shared combination on a NAV  with the new offer increasing the redemption amount to approximately $136 million  which includes a Redemption Price of around 95.2% of the Reference NAV  reducing the implied discount to about 4.8%.  This represents a significant improvement from the original offer of at least $75 million and a deferred payment of around $11 million  which is tied to the gradual liquidation of an “Illiquid Redemption Portfolio”. Malibu Life Re  launched by Third Point in May 2024  is a life and annuity reinsurer focusing on predictable liabilities within the US fixed annuity market. It operates as a Class B(iii) licensed insurance company in the Cayman Islands. Combining with Malibu  TPIL highlighted  will transform the company into a compelling UK-listed reinsurance platform with a robust new business pipeline offering investors access to the fast-growing and highly profitable US fixed annuity market. The transaction had previously received the support of 45% of shareholders who recognise the significant value upside in Malibu  according to the announcement. Despite this vote  a formal group of investors  called TPIL Investor Group – comprising of Asset Value Investors  Evelyn Partners  Staude Capital  Almitas Capital  and Metage Capital – had opposed the transaction. The Investor Group stated: “The proposal rides roughshod over accepted UK corporate governance principles. If the Board wants to radically change strategy and structure to pursue an alternative that clearly benefits Third Point’s interests  there is no legitimate reason for the TPIL Board to not provide a full exit opportunity nor provide a vote of independent shareholders. Those that want to invest in Malibu should be free to do so and those that do not should not be forced to.” The group had previously said it would engage with regulators  the board and the shareholders to ensure the transaction addressed the interests of all parties.

Key resistance at $0.463 could unlock upside momentum toward $0.58.

Posted: August 14  2025       By: Vivaan Acharya  Journalist             Edited By: Jacob Thomas             Vivaan Acharya  Journalist              Edited By: Jacob Thomas   Posted: August 14  2025      Share this article                                     Share     Tweet                                         Key Takeaways XLM’s price could soar by 25% and reach the $0.58 level in the future if the asset clears the $0.463 hurdle.  After nearly a week of sideways movement  Stellar [XLM] was mirroring Ripple’s [XRP] bullish patterns.  This formation has drawn expert attention  suggesting the asset is poised for potential upside momentum.     Notably  a renowned crypto analyst shared a post on X (formerly Twitter) highlighting a bullish inverted head and shoulders pattern.  In the post  the expert noted that a breakout and a candle closing above the $0.50 mark could propel XLM to the $0.77 level. Mapping upcoming levels  At press time  XLM was trading at $0.4532  reflecting a 2% gain over the past 24 hours.  This level remains a critical resistance zone  where the asset has repeatedly encountered selling pressure and downward momentum. Despite its sluggish performance over the past week  trader and investor participation has surged.  According to CoinMarketCap  XLM’s 24-hour trading volume jumped 51% compared to the previous day. This spike in trading volume  coupled with the price uptick  suggests that XLM may be gearing up to challenge its current resistance. Technical analysis from AMBCrypto reveals that XLM has formed a chart pattern similar to XRP on the daily timeframe.  Both assets have broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole formation  yet continue to struggle with an inverted head and shoulders pattern  a setup that typically signals further upside. Based on recent price action and historical patterns  XLM’s sideways trend is likely to end only if it breaks above $0.463. Should this breakout occur  XLM could rally by as much as 25%  potentially reaching the $0.58 level in the near future. Source: TradingView Technical indicators and on-chain insights  At the time of writing  technical indicators were flashing a mixed sentiment.   XLM’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) stood at 60. This indicated a potential for further upside momentum if buying pressure continues.   In the meantime  XLM price was at the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands  indicating strong bullish pressure but also signaling that the asset may face short-term resistance or a potential pullback. Given the current market structure  it appears that traders are closely following market trends.  CoinGlass revealed that XLM’s major liquidation levels were at $0.4461 on the lower side and $0.4737 on the upper side. Source: CoinGlass Furthermore  traders are heavily over-leveraged at these levels  with $4.41 million worth of long positions and $7.79 million worth of short positions. This makes it clear that traders hold a bearish outlook  believing the asset is now poised for a price dip.

Here are 11 moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it.  11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show It | YourTango ☰    Revolutionizing Your Relationships Main navigation Love Quotes Zodiac Horoscope Entertainment & News Family Self Health & Wellness Heartbreak Expert Advice 11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show It  Login Register   X Hamburger menu Love Zodiac Horoscope Entertainment & News Quotes Astrology Career & Money Self Sex Health & Wellness Love Quotes Divorce Family Heartbreak Expert Advice Experiences Search Articles Sign in Sign up for Newsletter Privacy Policy   HomeLove 11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show ItAn unhealthy relationship can be emotionally draining and destabilizing.Zayda SlabbekoornWritten on Aug 14  2025    PeopleImages.com - Yuri A | Shutterstock AdvertisementConsidering social relationships and long-term partnerships tend to be a large and fruitful aspect of our lives  when we grow disconnected from our partners  it can be truly heartbreaking and disorienting. Especially for married couples whose lives are framed in the context of the other  feel unheard  uncomfortable  or resentful of each other can negatively affect every aspect of their lives.Many of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it  contribute to this feeling of separation between partners that can spiral into much bigger problems. From feeling misunderstood in the relationship — like a study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships suggests can trigger powerful emotions — to lacking intimacy  even subtle moments can be signs of more significant relationship concerns.Here are 11 moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it1. Feeling unheard   Inside Creative House | ShutterstockEspecially in vulnerable situations — like during an argument  when he's being open  or expressing emotions — feeling unheard by their partner is one of the moments that quietly breaks a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it. As a ""cornerstone of intimate relationships "" feeling heard isn't just a predictor of communication skills and intimacy in a marriage  like a study from PLOS One suggests  it's also ingrained in feelings of self-worth and self-development.If a husband doesn't feel like he can be vulnerable or open without being judged or dismissed  he's likely to drift apart from his partner  mending internal feelings of being misunderstood  unvalued  or unappreciated.RELATED: 12 Subtle Things That Happen Right Before A Couple Drifts ApartAdvertisement2. His partner not prioritizing quality time   Face Stock | ShutterstockWhether it's working long hours  opting for nights out with friends over quality time together  or getting distracted by their phone on dates  having a partner who consistently chooses other things over intentional quality time can silently break a man's heart.According to a study from the Journal of Family Psychology  married couples tend to boast happier  healthier  and more fulfilling lives than their unmarried counterparts  but only when they engage in regularly healthy behaviors together — from open communication  to emotional and physical intimacy  and quality time.Of course  amid the chaos of life  constant quality time and regular date nights aren't always completely feasible for married couples. However  finding small pockets of intentional time together is always possible  which is why many husbands feel dismissed and overlooked when they have to beg for this time together.RELATED: 7 Signs Your Great Relationship Is About To Become A Very Lonely MarriageAdvertisement3. Being a 'scapegoat'   Perfect Wave | ShutterstockWhen a spouse resorts to playing the victim in arguments  blame-shifting to avoid accountability  or blaming their partner directly for marital problems and household dilemmas  it not only negatively affects trust and connection in their marriage  it also isolates husbands.Like psychotherapist Tonya Lester argues  this blame-shifting behavior is often associated with narcissistic tendencies in a partner  but it can also be a sign of low self-esteem  chronic stress  or even resentment in a marriage.That's why being a ""scapegoat"" is one of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it. He doesn't feel like he's attacking problems or solving issues on the same team as his partner  but rather  fighting to defend himself and ""win"" an argument on the opposing side.RELATED: If You Care About Your Marriage  Research Says These Are The 6 Correct Ways To ArgueAdvertisement4. Feeling like an obligation   Nenad Cavoski | ShutterstockWhether it's feeling pressured to beg for quality time together or feeling like physical and emotional intimacy is a chore  these are some of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it.Especially with physical intimacy and touch — that many male partners tend to prioritize and desire more than their wives  according to a study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships — if they feel dismissed or criticized for seeking it out  they're likely to feel isolated and unheard in their relationships.The more isolated they become  the more resentment they consume  and the more likely they are to further separate from their partner  avoiding moments of physical touch and emotional intimacy that truly connect partners amid rough patches.RELATED: The 4 Rare Types Of Intimacy The Happiest Couples Have  According To PsychologyAdvertisement5. Avoiding conversations about the future   Prostock-studio | ShutterstockAccording to a study from Family Relations  long-term relationships and marriages aren't simply ""healthy"" because they have a certain number of years under their belt — they take work  regular practices  and development to maintain. That's why regular check-ins  conversations about the future  and vulnerable moments where both partners can express their concerns and emotions are incredibly important to get on the same page.That's why avoiding conversations about the future or minimizing their importance are some of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it. Not only does it encourage both partners to avoid concerns that later fester into resentment  it sabotages the connection  personal development  and emotional intimacy necessary to continue evolving in a healthy manner as a couple.RELATED: 11 Things Deeply-In-Love Couples Do Differently That Help Them Grow Stronger During Hard TimesAdvertisement6. His partner consistently being distracted by their phone   Jose Calsina | ShutterstockAccording to a Utah State University survey  the most disconnected couples also tend to have the highest screen time and technology usage — with partners who grapple with personal consequences  like depression  anxiety  and stress  and also harmful side effects to their relationships  like lacking affection and communication.When they're expressing emotions or seeking out emotional intimacy with a partner  it's not surprising that they feel dismissed and unheard when their partner is looking at their phone. It's one of the leading causes of disconnection between marital partners  especially considering phones have become the center of many people's lives — harboring their closest relationships  entertainment and coping activities  and work.RELATED: 5 Behaviors That Instantly Reveal A Husband Is More Loving And Kind Than All The RestAdvertisement7. Feeling rejected   Just Life | ShutterstockLike a study published by BMC Psychology suggests  rejection is a powerful experience that can alter the daily behaviors and interactions between marital partners.

"11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show ItWhen a man's partner doesn't treat him well  inside he's breaking down. Here are 11 moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it.  11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show It | YourTango ☰    Revolutionizing Your Relationships Main navigation Love Quotes Zodiac Horoscope Entertainment & News Family Self Health & Wellness Heartbreak Expert Advice 11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show It  Login Register   X Hamburger menu Love Zodiac Horoscope Entertainment & News Quotes Astrology Career & Money Self Sex Health & Wellness Love Quotes Divorce Family Heartbreak Expert Advice Experiences Search Articles Sign in Sign up for Newsletter Privacy Policy   HomeLove 11 Moments That Quietly Break A Husband's Heart  Even If He Doesn't Show ItAn unhealthy relationship can be emotionally draining and destabilizing.Zayda SlabbekoornWritten on Aug 14  2025    PeopleImages.com - Yuri A | Shutterstock AdvertisementConsidering social relationships and long-term partnerships tend to be a large and fruitful aspect of our lives  when we grow disconnected from our partners  it can be truly heartbreaking and disorienting. Especially for married couples whose lives are framed in the context of the other  feel unheard  uncomfortable  or resentful of each other can negatively affect every aspect of their lives.Many of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it  contribute to this feeling of separation between partners that can spiral into much bigger problems. From feeling misunderstood in the relationship — like a study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships suggests can trigger powerful emotions — to lacking intimacy  even subtle moments can be signs of more significant relationship concerns.Here are 11 moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it1. Feeling unheard   Inside Creative House | ShutterstockEspecially in vulnerable situations — like during an argument  when he's being open  or expressing emotions — feeling unheard by their partner is one of the moments that quietly breaks a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it. As a ""cornerstone of intimate relationships "" feeling heard isn't just a predictor of communication skills and intimacy in a marriage  like a study from PLOS One suggests  it's also ingrained in feelings of self-worth and self-development.If a husband doesn't feel like he can be vulnerable or open without being judged or dismissed  he's likely to drift apart from his partner  mending internal feelings of being misunderstood  unvalued  or unappreciated.RELATED: 12 Subtle Things That Happen Right Before A Couple Drifts ApartAdvertisement2. His partner not prioritizing quality time   Face Stock | ShutterstockWhether it's working long hours  opting for nights out with friends over quality time together  or getting distracted by their phone on dates  having a partner who consistently chooses other things over intentional quality time can silently break a man's heart.According to a study from the Journal of Family Psychology  married couples tend to boast happier  healthier  and more fulfilling lives than their unmarried counterparts  but only when they engage in regularly healthy behaviors together — from open communication  to emotional and physical intimacy  and quality time.Of course  amid the chaos of life  constant quality time and regular date nights aren't always completely feasible for married couples. However  finding small pockets of intentional time together is always possible  which is why many husbands feel dismissed and overlooked when they have to beg for this time together.RELATED: 7 Signs Your Great Relationship Is About To Become A Very Lonely MarriageAdvertisement3. Being a 'scapegoat'   Perfect Wave | ShutterstockWhen a spouse resorts to playing the victim in arguments  blame-shifting to avoid accountability  or blaming their partner directly for marital problems and household dilemmas  it not only negatively affects trust and connection in their marriage  it also isolates husbands.Like psychotherapist Tonya Lester argues  this blame-shifting behavior is often associated with narcissistic tendencies in a partner  but it can also be a sign of low self-esteem  chronic stress  or even resentment in a marriage.That's why being a ""scapegoat"" is one of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it. He doesn't feel like he's attacking problems or solving issues on the same team as his partner  but rather  fighting to defend himself and ""win"" an argument on the opposing side.RELATED: If You Care About Your Marriage  Research Says These Are The 6 Correct Ways To ArgueAdvertisement4. Feeling like an obligation   Nenad Cavoski | ShutterstockWhether it's feeling pressured to beg for quality time together or feeling like physical and emotional intimacy is a chore  these are some of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it.Especially with physical intimacy and touch — that many male partners tend to prioritize and desire more than their wives  according to a study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships — if they feel dismissed or criticized for seeking it out  they're likely to feel isolated and unheard in their relationships.The more isolated they become  the more resentment they consume  and the more likely they are to further separate from their partner  avoiding moments of physical touch and emotional intimacy that truly connect partners amid rough patches.RELATED: The 4 Rare Types Of Intimacy The Happiest Couples Have  According To PsychologyAdvertisement5. Avoiding conversations about the future   Prostock-studio | ShutterstockAccording to a study from Family Relations  long-term relationships and marriages aren't simply ""healthy"" because they have a certain number of years under their belt — they take work  regular practices  and development to maintain. That's why regular check-ins  conversations about the future  and vulnerable moments where both partners can express their concerns and emotions are incredibly important to get on the same page.That's why avoiding conversations about the future or minimizing their importance are some of the moments that quietly break a husband's heart  even if he doesn't show it. Not only does it encourage both partners to avoid concerns that later fester into resentment  it sabotages the connection  personal development  and emotional intimacy necessary to continue evolving in a healthy manner as a couple.RELATED: 11 Things Deeply-In-Love Couples Do Differently That Help Them Grow Stronger During Hard TimesAdvertisement6. His partner consistently being distracted by their phone   Jose Calsina | ShutterstockAccording to a Utah State University survey  the most disconnected couples also tend to have the highest screen time and technology usage — with partners who grapple with personal consequences  like depression  anxiety  and stress  and also harmful side effects to their relationships  like lacking affection and communication.When they're expressing emotions or seeking out emotional intimacy with a partner  it's not surprising that they feel dismissed and unheard when their partner is looking at their phone. It's one of the leading causes of disconnection between marital partners  especially considering phones have become the center of many people's lives — harboring their closest relationships  entertainment and coping activities  and work.RELATED: 5 Behaviors That Instantly Reveal A Husband Is More Loving And Kind Than All The RestAdvertisement7. Feeling rejected   Just Life | ShutterstockLike a study published by BMC Psychology suggests  rejection is a powerful experience that can alter the daily behaviors and interactions between marital partners.

Silence (Silencio)  a miniseries directed by Spanish filmmaker Eduardo Casanova (Skins) that combines the vampire mythos with the AIDS epidemic  will be part of the official selection at genre festival Fantastic Fest in Austin  which runs Sept. 18-25  following its international premiere at the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival.   In 2023  the screenwriter and director won the best film award at the festival for La Piedad.    Silence  a blend of thriller and psychological drama with a striking visual style  is the first series created by Casanova. It unfolds in two timelines: the Europe devastated by the Black Plague and 1980s Spain amid the AIDS crisis.

Centuries later  one of their descendants faces a similar scenario: the AIDS pandemic in Spain. There  she discovers that although time has passed  social condemnation remains just as piercing. And the love between the ‘sick’ and the ‘healthy ’ between vampires and humans  still provokes the same fear.”   The cast of the series includes Leticia Dolera  María Leon  Ana Polvorosa  Omar Ayuso  Lucía Díez and Ana Polvorosa.   “I’ve always been struck by the way people referred to the first AIDS patients back when thedisease was still deadly: The Pink Plague ” Casanova explains in a director’s statement. “Silence uses the myth of vampires as a metaphor to reflect on social stigma and condemnation through two pandemics  the Black Death and AIDS. Though they’re separated by centuries and shaped by very different social contexts  both are bound by a shared thread: fear and rejection.”                     ‘Silence’      He concludes: “Silence itself can be deadly. At the same time  I’m blending two genres that fascinate me  and that I feel have never been explicitly merged in this way: vampire horror and queer cinema. Both deal with viruses transmitted through fluids like blood  a central element both in vampirism and in HIV discourse.”   Check out a clip from the three-episode series below.

Put in your money  turn the crank  and out comes one of usually four or five tchotchkes. Which one will you get? Not knowing is part of the fun. They’re called gachapon in Japanese  although we mostly just say gacha gacha. (“Gacha” is the sound of the crank turning  and “pon” is the capsule popping out of the chute.) They’re incredibly popular now  with all kinds of toys inside ranging from anime characters to cute little animals. They also like to make reproductions of consumer goods like food  stereo equipment  and sometimes even musical instruments. That’s where the Roland Miniature Collection comes in. Roland Miniature Collection TR-808 · Source: Bandai / Roland Recently announced  the Roland Miniature Collection contains four diminutive versions of Roland products  including the Jupiter-X synthesizer  JC-120 and Blues Cube Artist 212 guitar amps  and TR-808 drum machine. They look just like the real thing  only tiny. The 808 is only around 4 cm across. That is small indeed. So how can you get ahold of one (or all!) of the Roland Miniature Collection? The items are currently available for pre-order on the Bandai site (link below). It’s all in Japanese  so you’ll need a robust translation app. And keep in mind that the site is also like a gacha machine – you don’t know which one you’ll get until it arrives in the mail. If you’d rather buy one from a machine  they’ll hit the streets of Japan in late November  which is presumably when pre-orders will start shipping too. Of course  if you can’t make it to Japan  you’ll want to look online for resellers. Many will sell all four in a single set  if that’s what you’re after. If you’d rather have the real thing  some of the products represented in the Roland Miniature Collection are available at Thomann*.

An inside-out synthesizer. This is Polygene II  a 24-voice polyphonic analog synthesizer from musician and developer LA Priest and his company Gene Synths  and pretty much everything on it is conductive. “Touching any part of the synthesizer bridges connections in the circuitry and creates a unique sound ” says the developer. Get in touch  why don’t you? Gene Synths Polygene II · Source: Gene Synths Polygene II contains two halves. One is inspired by the kinds of all-transistor analog synths of the early days like the Moog Minimoog and EMS Synthi  while the other half employs analog chips to generate customizable waveforms. There are two keyboard areas  one for each half  with the top one having 24 pressure-sensitive polyphonic pads and at the bottom  a 24-note keyboard for triggering “more familiar polyphonic synthesizer voices.” It’s got 12 tunable oscillators plus 12 harmonic subs  eight wave-shaping controls  24 envelope generators with separate release control for each octave of the keyboard  a unique resonant transistor filter  and more. Polygene II is very unusual but also very cool  and it sounds beautiful. Gene Synths is now taking pre-orders at a special introductory price of £959.

But do you have a smartphone microphone? Probably not. I’ll bet since I said that you want one now. Well  you’re in luck  as Intellijel has just released MEMS Mic  a 2HP microphone module. Intellijel MEMS Mic · Source: Intellijel MEMS stands for Micro Electro Mechanical System  and this is the kind of tiny microphone you often find in devices like smartphones and tablets. Intellijel had the bright idea to put one in a Eurorack module. These mini mics have a very flat response across a large frequency range (around 6Hz to 20kHz)  “which makes them excellent for musical applications ” according to the company. Why not pick one up while you’re waiting for the company to release its much-anticipated Jellymix Mixer? The Intellijel MEMS Mix is available at Thomann*.

Instead of relying solely on personal knowledge or random discovery  these methods can surface knowledge discrepancies more objectively  thereby enabling the Wikimedia community to direct editorial and technical efforts precisely to areas that most need attention. You’ve jumped into the fourth post in our series; check out our previous posts: ● Post 1: An Overview of Wikipedia’s Structural Framework ● Post 2: Navigating Wikipedia’s Knowledge Discrepancies   ● Post 3: Prioritizing Wikipedia’s Knowledge Gaps          The Wikimedia community  consisting of volunteers and staff  has developed numerous tools and workflows. Many of these  though originally intended for other purposes  can be adapted to map these diverse knowledge discrepancies. This post will categorize and describe a selection of tools and workflows based on the type of gap they help identify. It’s important to note that this discussion exclusively addresses gaps within Wikipedia itself  excluding sister projects like Wikimedia Commons or Wiktionary. Furthermore  we will focus strictly on tools  excluding individual user scripts or administrative mass-cleanup utilities  prioritizing those available in English for broader understanding. Tools for Mapping Missing Content Identifying where information is entirely absent  whether it’s a missing article or critical content within an existing one  is a fundamental aspect of gap mapping. Several tools exist to highlight these omissions:  PetScan: A very useful tool for allowing users to create highly customized queries of Wikipedia data. By combining various criteria such as page size  category membership  and Wikidata linkage  PetScan is extensively used for mapping coverage gaps. For example  one could find all articles within a certain category with empty sections  suggesting incomplete coverage. Listeria: Designed for generating and updating dynamic lists  Listeria can auto-populate tables of items from Wikidata. This functionality is particularly useful for identifying notable individuals  places  or concepts that have a presence in Wikidata but currently lack a corresponding Wikipedia article in a target language. SPARQL: As a powerful query language for Wikidata  SPARQL enables complex  sophisticated data retrieval. This allows users to find notable topics absent from specific language editions of Wikipedia by querying Wikidata. An example might be finding all Mexican climate activists born between 1980 and 2000 who have a Wikidata item but are missing an article in the French Wikipedia. Wiki Shoot Me: Visually intuitive tool that maps Wikidata items missing corresponding images. For instance  it’s effective for quickly finding public art installations that lack photographic documentation on Wikimedia Commons. FIST (Free Image Search Tool): This tool recommends images that are present in Wikimedia Commons or Wikidata but are currently missing from relevant Wikipedia articles  addressing visual content gaps directly. WikiCompleter: Can be used for identifying topics that are well-covered in many Wikipedia languages but are conspicuously absent from a specific target language  highlighting translation/coverage gaps. Navboxes: Thematic navigational boxes  or “navboxes ” provide a visual and practical means of mapping gaps. These templates often contain internal links to existing articles within a specific theme or topic area  with red links visually indicating articles that are missing but considered relevant. Not In The Other Language: As its name suggests  this tool helps identify topics that have an article in one Wikipedia edition but are missing in another  facilitating cross-language content expansion efforts. WikiMap: Focusing on geographical knowledge gaps  this tool allows users to pinpoint images absent from a specific location  such as photographs for monuments in San Francisco.   Navbox showing topics related to telecommunication in Europe.Topics without an article on English Wikipedia are shown in red. Tools for Mapping Poorly Structured Content Poorly structured content  as we discussed in Blog Post 2  encompasses a range of issues from inaccuracy to disorganization. Identifying these nuances often relies on community input and automated analysis:  Maintenance Templates: Wikipedians actively flag poorly structured content by adding various maintenance templates directly to articles or sections (e.g.  {{citation needed}}  {{outdated}}  {{cleanup}}  {{unreferenced}}). These templates serve to signal specific quality issues.  PetScan: PetScan’s versatility extends to sorting and filtering these maintenance templates. It can generate lists of articles that have been tagged with specific maintenance templates  allowing editors to find poorly structured content pertaining to specific issues  such as statements without citations or articles containing outdated information. Citation Hunt: This tool specifically identifies statements within Wikipedia articles that are flagged as needing references. It presents these statements to users in an easy-to-use interface  facilitating targeted improvements in verifiability and reducing the number of unverified claims. Manual article assessment and ORES scores: Wikipedia uses manual article assessment  where experienced editors rate articles on scales such as Stub  Start  C  B  Good Article (GA)  and Featured Article (FA). Automated quality predictions are also generated by the Objective Revision Evaluation Service (ORES)  which uses machine learning models trained on past assessments to estimate the likely quality of an article. A highly important article rated low on the quality scale by both manual and machine assessment could indicate knowledge discrepancies.  Tools for Mapping Surplus Content Surplus content refers to material that either doesn’t belong on Wikipedia or is inappropriately included (e.g.  copyright violations  vandalism  non-notable topics). The following tools help identify and manage these unwanted additions:  Copyvio Detector: This tool helps find content on Wikipedia that has been copied from external copyrighted sources  such as textbooks  ensuring adherence to Wikipedia’s open-licensing policies. Community Activity Logs: While not a “mapping” tool in the sense of finding content types  these logs detect sudden or unusual activity that is often indicative of mass vandalism or spam. By monitoring these logs  communities can discover such events in real time and initiate a rapid response to remove unwanted content. PetScan: Again  PetScan can also be utilized to identify articles with promotional  non-notable  or other undesirable content. It does this by generating lists of articles marked by specific maintenance templates (e.g.  {{advert}}  {{notability}}) that indicate various types of surplus content.  Tools for Mapping Cataloging Gaps Cataloging gaps occur when the structural metadata  such as categories or Wikidata connection  is missing or incorrect  hindering discoverability and machine processing.  Duplicity: Identifying Wikipedia articles that do not have a corresponding item on Wikidata  highlighting discrepancies between the structural data repository and Wikipedia’s article base. Bridging these gaps enhance cross-project connectivity and machine readability. HotCat and Cat-a-lot: These user-friendly tools are designed to streamline the process of managing categories on Wikipedia. HotCat allows editors to quickly add  remove  or change categories directly from the article view  while Cat-a-lot facilitates mass changes to categories across multiple articles  significantly improving the efficiency of this process.  There are several other tools for mapping cataloging gaps  but these are generally used by experienced users engaged in article cleanup. Some can only be accessed by users with extended rights. For brevity  we do not list them here. External Tools Beyond Wikimedia Ecosystem Many tools developed outside Wikimedia’s immediate ecosystem can be used for mapping knowledge gaps. Data Visualization Tools (such as Tableau public) could be used to analyze Wikipedia’s content in new ways  revealing patterns that might not be obvious from raw data. External Academic Databases (such as the MeSH database) can be used to compare against the knowledge present on Wikipedia  highlighting gaps in scholarly coverage. Emerging Artificial Intelligence technologies  such as Generative Large Language Models (such as ChatGPT Deep Research)  can synthesize information against prompts designed to specifically find knowledge gaps in a given article on a topic area. Search Engine Analysis tools (such as Google Trends) can help highlight public interest topics that Wikipedia doesn’t currently have robust content for.  Workflows for Mapping Wikipedia’s Knowledge Discrepancies Beyond individual tools  Wikipedia’s knowledge gaps are systematically mapped through established community workflows. WikiProjects serve as dedicated hubs where editors collaborate around specific topics or themes (e.g.  WikiProject Medicine  WikiProject Women in Red). WikiProjects are crucial for identifying and addressing content gaps systematically within their areas of interest. Among these  the WikiProject Missing Encyclopedic Articles explicitly aims to identify notable topics that lack articles on Wikipedia. Additionally  the Vital Articles List highlights a curated set of core topics essential for any encyclopedia  signaling which articles demand the most rigorous quality improvements. Tools like Programs & Events Dashboard are useful for event organizers to track the progress in the development of a group of articles over time. They allow for the creation and tracking of lists of articles needing improvement  effectively coordinating edit-a-thons and campaigns aimed at closing specific knowledge gaps. Other methods include comparative language edition analyses backed by Wikidata  where gaps where a topic is well-covered in one language but missing or underdeveloped in another inform editors in the less-developed language of potential expansion opportunities (e.g.  using vital article comparison tools). Mapping from external databases such as academic indexes (such as ORCID for researchers) or cultural heritage collections (like Sum of All Paintings for artwork) also reveals specific topics or subjects that are well-documented externally but are absent on Wikipedia. Lastly  advanced workflows can leverage more than one of the tools mentioned above  such as data generated from the SPARQL interface being visualized on an external website (e.g.  Humaniki). Together  these structured tools and collaborative workflows make it possible to visualize unseen gaps  enabling the Wikimedia community to turn them into actionable tasks. Wrapping up In this blog post  we have aimed to introduce some popular tools and workflows for systematically identifying and visualizing knowledge gaps. While this list is by no means comprehensive  we hope it will be useful for editors  event organizers  and developers to start familiarizing themselves with the tools they need in their arsenal for daily work.

                                           August 14  2025 12:00 PM  1       Back in 2021  I wrote a piece for this very feature speculating about the future of titles that had binned themselves as spiritual successors to City of Heroes  which very much included and still includes Ship of Heroes. Two things have changed in the four years since then (fine  loads of things have changed  but two things that are relevant to this column). The first is that SoH is just about to launch for real  making it the one game out of that batch that has made it to being a fully featured title in its own right. The other is that CoH came back and secured an official license. Those two things juxtaposed are sure something  huh? Now  cards on the table  I want SoH to be a huge success because I really like superheroes and like superhero games and always want new titles to be successful. But as someone who spends a lot of time talking about superheroic MMOs and thinking about them  I also have to look at the game as it actually exists rather than just what I might like to imagine. And I have to be real  my first thought is not that this is going to end well.  See  here’s the thing about CoH. It is an absolutely wonderful game I love  and it is also a gigantic pile of compromises and half-measures built on a decade of jank even before it got turned over to fan developers. I’ve had some critiques of the game’s overall balance on the now-official servers  and that’s a thing to be concerned with  but the reality is that even if you push that to one side  the game still just has fundamental issues that inform its mechanics from top to bottom. This isn’t a bad thing. Any video game being released in a playable form is difficult  MMORPGs are even more challenging to get over the finish line  and the game was designed with a lot of older technology and hardware that made sense at the time. My point here is not that someone screwed up when making the game; my point is that there are things CoH does badly just by virtue of its age  and while they are part of the game’s charm  they are not part of its appeal.  For example  CoH kind of has something that is at least adjacent to an LFG tool on Homecoming  but it’s not very good or widely used  and that makes sense because that wasn’t really a major part of how video games were designed in 2004. It was not a thing the tool was ever really made to do. You can get around it  but it does still prove to be a problem  and as someone who has done lots of manual group forming in the game  I can assure you that a lot of the reason the game persists in spite of that is that grouping is so loose and ad-hoc that you don’t need to look for tanks or healers too closely. That doesn’t make it good. It is  in fact  bad. The game would be objectively better if you could just queue up for a task force or even just radio hunting. But we  collectively  as players of the game  accept that it’s not there and must be worked around. Yet here we have SoH not just admitting it won’t be in but kind of trying to flaunt it  like it’s a feature. You might argue that this isn’t unusual because this is a game clearly meant for sickos who love CoH rather than a totally new title to be taken on its own merits. And this is wrong  but even if we take that at face value  it’s still a bad argument because it’s overlooking an important fact I mentioned right in the introduction. In 2021  when I wrote that earlier piece  CoH had a rogue server. That rogue server is now official. That is the game. I am perfectly happy to call out weirdness in balancing with CoH  but that is not in and of itself an advertisement to move away from that game – which is completely free and is also the game I already love – to a new title that is trying hard to feel like CoH but being rebuilt from first principles. I have no doubt there are people who are more unhappy with the game than I am  but I also don’t believe that audience is going to be attracted to a clone of the same game. “Clone” probably sounds derogatory  but in this case I mean it more in the sense of “Doom clone.” That’s a more specific kind of derogatory. It’s not saying that the game is identical to the earlier title; it’s that the game is designed to hew as close as possible to another title. And it really needs new blood  not just a hopeful flood of CoH fans who don’t want to play the official servers. Which is hard to do when your design goal seems to be emulating the jank of that title.  I don’t like feeling as if I don’t have a whole lot of great things to say because as I mentioned before  I am on Team Wants This To Succeed. Even if I didn’t love the subject matter  which I do  the game is actually releasing  and it’s very obvious that the team has managed to do a whole heck of a lot with an absolutely tiny budget. That’s incredible. Like Shenmue 3  whatever else you can say about the project when it releases  the fact it exists is so laudable that you kinda want to grade on a heavy curve just because of that. But MMOs thrive on their playerbases. They thrive  in part  on players feeling as if they’re buying in not just to a current release but to the future. A new game is an investment in future updates you expect to play. And if players look at a game and think that it doesn’t have a future  they’re less likely to show up and invest in the game  which leaves you with a dwindling base and serious problems. I think SoH has parked itself in the worst possible spot between two worlds. It’s too similar to CoH to really distinguish itself as a completely original and separate project that just happens to share the base conceit of a superheroic MMORPG  but it’s not actually CoH even as it inherits elements from that title. There is a band of people who are going to be interested  but I think it’s going to be an uphill battle getting a critical mass of new players who want to invest their time and effort into the game. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the combat on release will feel amazing and fluid in a way that isn’t conveyed well in videos (it wouldn’t necessarily be alone in that)  and maybe it will ultimately feel like an alternate evolution aside from the way that other titles have gone in a totally different direction. As it stands now  though  I’m more than a little worried about its long-term prospects. And sure  the long-term isn’t everything  but it’s going to influence first impressions just as surely.

                                           August 14  2025 12:00 PM  1       Back in 2021  I wrote a piece for this very feature speculating about the future of titles that had binned themselves as spiritual successors to City of Heroes  which very much included and still includes Ship of Heroes. Two things have changed in the four years since then (fine  loads of things have changed  but two things that are relevant to this column). The first is that SoH is just about to launch for real  making it the one game out of that batch that has made it to being a fully featured title in its own right. The other is that CoH came back and secured an official license. Those two things juxtaposed are sure something  huh? Now  cards on the table  I want SoH to be a huge success because I really like superheroes and like superhero games and always want new titles to be successful. But as someone who spends a lot of time talking about superheroic MMOs and thinking about them  I also have to look at the game as it actually exists rather than just what I might like to imagine. And I have to be real  my first thought is not that this is going to end well.  See  here’s the thing about CoH. It is an absolutely wonderful game I love  and it is also a gigantic pile of compromises and half-measures built on a decade of jank even before it got turned over to fan developers. I’ve had some critiques of the game’s overall balance on the now-official servers  and that’s a thing to be concerned with  but the reality is that even if you push that to one side  the game still just has fundamental issues that inform its mechanics from top to bottom. This isn’t a bad thing. Any video game being released in a playable form is difficult  MMORPGs are even more challenging to get over the finish line  and the game was designed with a lot of older technology and hardware that made sense at the time. My point here is not that someone screwed up when making the game; my point is that there are things CoH does badly just by virtue of its age  and while they are part of the game’s charm  they are not part of its appeal.  For example  CoH kind of has something that is at least adjacent to an LFG tool on Homecoming  but it’s not very good or widely used  and that makes sense because that wasn’t really a major part of how video games were designed in 2004. It was not a thing the tool was ever really made to do. You can get around it  but it does still prove to be a problem  and as someone who has done lots of manual group forming in the game  I can assure you that a lot of the reason the game persists in spite of that is that grouping is so loose and ad-hoc that you don’t need to look for tanks or healers too closely. That doesn’t make it good. It is  in fact  bad. The game would be objectively better if you could just queue up for a task force or even just radio hunting. But we  collectively  as players of the game  accept that it’s not there and must be worked around. Yet here we have SoH not just admitting it won’t be in but kind of trying to flaunt it  like it’s a feature. You might argue that this isn’t unusual because this is a game clearly meant for sickos who love CoH rather than a totally new title to be taken on its own merits. And this is wrong  but even if we take that at face value  it’s still a bad argument because it’s overlooking an important fact I mentioned right in the introduction. In 2021  when I wrote that earlier piece  CoH had a rogue server. That rogue server is now official. That is the game. I am perfectly happy to call out weirdness in balancing with CoH  but that is not in and of itself an advertisement to move away from that game – which is completely free and is also the game I already love – to a new title that is trying hard to feel like CoH but being rebuilt from first principles. I have no doubt there are people who are more unhappy with the game than I am  but I also don’t believe that audience is going to be attracted to a clone of the same game. “Clone” probably sounds derogatory  but in this case I mean it more in the sense of “Doom clone.” That’s a more specific kind of derogatory. It’s not saying that the game is identical to the earlier title; it’s that the game is designed to hew as close as possible to another title. And it really needs new blood  not just a hopeful flood of CoH fans who don’t want to play the official servers. Which is hard to do when your design goal seems to be emulating the jank of that title.  I don’t like feeling as if I don’t have a whole lot of great things to say because as I mentioned before  I am on Team Wants This To Succeed. Even if I didn’t love the subject matter  which I do  the game is actually releasing  and it’s very obvious that the team has managed to do a whole heck of a lot with an absolutely tiny budget. That’s incredible. Like Shenmue 3  whatever else you can say about the project when it releases  the fact it exists is so laudable that you kinda want to grade on a heavy curve just because of that. But MMOs thrive on their playerbases. They thrive  in part  on players feeling as if they’re buying in not just to a current release but to the future. A new game is an investment in future updates you expect to play. And if players look at a game and think that it doesn’t have a future  they’re less likely to show up and invest in the game  which leaves you with a dwindling base and serious problems. I think SoH has parked itself in the worst possible spot between two worlds. It’s too similar to CoH to really distinguish itself as a completely original and separate project that just happens to share the base conceit of a superheroic MMORPG  but it’s not actually CoH even as it inherits elements from that title. There is a band of people who are going to be interested  but I think it’s going to be an uphill battle getting a critical mass of new players who want to invest their time and effort into the game. Maybe I’m wrong. Maybe the combat on release will feel amazing and fluid in a way that isn’t conveyed well in videos (it wouldn’t necessarily be alone in that)  and maybe it will ultimately feel like an alternate evolution aside from the way that other titles have gone in a totally different direction. As it stands now  though  I’m more than a little worried about its long-term prospects. And sure  the long-term isn’t everything  but it’s going to influence first impressions just as surely.

You’ll find a great rundown on the Bulgaria nomad visa here at SofiaExpats.com and sign up for her great Sofia newsletter if you’ll spend any time there. Here’s an article on changes in the Croatia one  including a longer timeline of 18 months if you’ve can show high enough income or savings. Electric Travel Toothbrush  Take 2 Back in July of 2024 I highlighted the slim Philips One by Sonicare electric travel toothbrush that I’d bought. I made a mistake and got the battery powered one instead of the rechargeable one but amazingly  the battery hasn’t been replaced since. I’ve been carrying a charged-up rechargeable AAA spare through two months in Europe  six weeks in the USA and Canada  and multiple other trips but still haven’t needed it! Southwest Airlines Changes in January If you were a fan of the previously unique Southwest Airlines  you’d better fly them before January 27. Free bag checks are already gone and in January they’ll become just like the other hated airlines  with complicated tiers of paid seat assignments and a dramatically slower cabin load time thanks to eight boarding groups. You get a break if you have their Chase credit card though  with a checked bag included and standard seat assignments for you and your travel companions so you can sit together. ($99 annual fee  but 100K points sign-up bonus after spending $4K.) Temperate Climate Cities This list of cities that are around 75F degrees/24C has some nice places to target if you prefer “eternal spring” climates that never get super hot or super cold  like the one I live in. You could create a whole list like this just with the central Mexico highlands and it is missing a few popular spots (like Boquete and El Valle de Anton in Panama). Plus Viña del Mar in Chile rarely tops 70F. But it highlights a few temperate places I hadn’t thought of before. Eat outside all year in Addis Ababa  Windhoek  Da Lat  or Arequipa.
